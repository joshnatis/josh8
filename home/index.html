                    Welcome to my humble abode. I've become something of an online trashman over the past few years -- I often stumble upon information that I don't want to lose, so I organize it here for my convenience (and maybe yours too, dig around maybe you'll find something cool). This is also a place to commemorate people who I admire. I like to humanize the gurus and legendary personas that I read and hear about. I find that birthdays help with this -- did you know that Ken Thompson and I almost share a birthday!? Have a good stay.

                <h2 id = "the_history">The history and people of computing </h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Much like everything else in life, computer science didn't appear out of thin air. I seldom come across anyone interested in the culture and history of computing and its subgroups, which is sad and kind of strange. The public view of CS seems to paint it as an ultra-practical skillset and a pathway to economic success. Perhaps this is a symptom of the divide between STEM and the humanities, or the inevitable side effect of Late Capitalism. Either way, to the layman, this rich history is virtually unknown, and Computer Science seems to be boiled down to the technical sum of its parts.
                    <br><br><br>
                    
                    With that in mind, here's a list of people worth knowing (in no particular order):
                </p>
                <p id="ppl">
                    Richard Stallman (rms), Eric S. Raymond (esr), Linus Torvalds, Jon Hall (maddog), Dennis M. Ritchie (dmr), Ken L. Thompson (ken), Brian W. Kernighan (bwk), Donald Knuth (dek), John Von Neumann, John G. Kemeny, Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, Tim Berners-Lee, Doug Engelbart, Edsger Dijkstra, John McCarthy, Aaron Swartz, Terry Davis, Joe Armstrong, Francesco Vianello, Richard Feynman, Leonard Susskind, Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Leonhard Euler, George Boole, Paul Erdös, Vint Cerf

                        let g = Math.floor((Math.random() * 255));
                        let b = Math.floor((Math.random() * 255));
                        return "rgb(" + r + "," + g + "," + b + ");"
                    }

                    let ppl = document.getElementById("ppl");
                    let str = "";
                    ppl.innerHTML.split(",").forEach(name =>
                        str += "<span style=\"white-space: nowrap; color: "

                    ppl.innerHTML = str.slice(0, -2);

The knights jump, the kings orbit, the sun goes down, and every move is the truth. It's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but it's in Estonian. </p>
                    <p> Today science is biased towards rejecting any theory involving God. It is called naturalism. It proposes that any and all observable phenomena must have a natural cause. It also has the side-effect of barring God from having any influence in the world. If it appears that God has an influence in the world, a different explanation must be found. And men are masters of creating alternative explanations. It is called skepticism.</p>
                    <p>Education is an extension of the human instinct to reproduce. One of the things we should be doing is to purposely invent better ways to think, and then figure out how to teach them to children to create much more able adults than we are.</p>

                    <p>In the 80s and 90s, engineers built complex systems by combining simple and well-understood parts. The goal of SICP was to provide the abstraction language for reasoning about such systems. Today, this is no longer the case. Engineers now routinely write code for complicated hardware that they don’t fully understand (and often can’t understand because of trade secrecy.) The same is true at the software level, since programming environments consist of gigantic libraries with enormous functionality. Programming today is “More like science. You grab this piece of library and you poke at it. You write programs that poke it and see what it does. And you say, ‘Can I tweak it to do the thing I want?'”. The “analysis-by-synthesis” view of SICP — where you build a larger system out of smaller, simple parts — became irrelevant. Nowadays, we do programming by poking.</p>
                    <p>I have no idea if other fields have this same problem — my guess is that physicists are particularly prone to it, since we are trained early on to think that physicists are simply smarter than chemists or biologists. Those other fields are for the hard workers. We don’t put mathemeticians on this scale, because we secretly believe they’re smarter than us. Note to the biologist lynch mob: tounge is in cheek.)</p>

                    <p>I find it bizarre that people use the term "coding" to mean programming. For decades, we used the word "coding" for the work of low-level staff in a business programming team. The designer would write a detailed flow chart, then the "coders" would write code to implement the flow chart. This is quite different from what we did and do in the hacker community -- with us, one person designs the program and writes its code as a single activity. When I developed GNU programs, that was programming, but it was definitely not coding. Since I don't think the recent fad for "coding" is an improvement, I have decided not to adopt it. I don't use the term "coding", except if I were talking about a business programming team which has coders.</p>

                    <p>People often miss this, or even deny it, but there are many examples of object-oriented programming in the kernel. Although the kernel developers may shun C++ and other explicitly object-oriented languages, thinking in terms of objects is often useful. The VFS [Virtual File System] is a good example of how to do clean and efficient OOP in C, which is a language that lacks any OOP constructs</p>
                    <p><i>Thompson</i>: One day I got this idea -- pipes, essentially exactly as they are today. I put them in the operating system in an hour -- they're trivial, they really are super trivial when you've got redirecting IO like UNIX already had. 
                    
					The idea was just mind blowing to us. Dennis and I came in and rewrote everything in the world -- our world, in one night. We converted everything. Mostly what we did was throw out extraneous messages. Like, sort would never say "hey I'm sorting, I'm merging, I'm doing this, I'm working on this file". All that garbage is gone -- sort would read, sort, then write. And suddenly sort was what we'd call a "filter" in that day. Then we converted everything that processed something into filters. It was massive, and just exciting.

					<i>Kernighan:</i> And the world changed, essentially overnight.

					<p><i>Thompson</i>: I've always been interested in chess, I played it when I was in 7th grade because that's when Bobby Fischer was right at his height. Bobby Fischer and I are like 10 years apart in age, except that he's dead. So, I would come home and on the cover of Life Magazine there'd be "Bobby Fischer". And here I am, exactly the same age, and what do I do? So I felt very very, I don't know, worthless. I joined the chess club and played chess in school, and was good at it, but I didn't like it. I didn't like to win -- because you feel sorry for somebody who'd take it seriously, and I didn't like to lose of course. And that cut down on my options.</p>

                    <p>The majority of ordinary people want to live a peaceful life. In fact, the people who are the most determined to live a peaceful and calm life are constantly running into capitalism as an insurmountable obstacle to living it. Every single day we're pushed aside, pushed at the job, we're put under all kinds of pressure in the family and society -- anywhere we go in capitalist society, which impedes on our very modest wish to live a perfectly ordinary, non-eventful and harmonious life. Because of the pressures the crisis of capitalism puts on these people, you see that the people who are most determined to live a normal and tranquil life are pushed towards drawing more and more radical and revolutionary ideas, contrary to their wishes. And that in fact is the driving force of all revolutions.</p>
                    <p>To be a Hegelian is to have a big stomach. You've got the whole world in thought. That's how we understand someone like Zizek -- he's got a very big philosophical stomach... there's nothing he can't digest.</p>

                    <p>‘You are not expected to understand this’ was intended as a remark in the spirit of ‘This won’t be on the exam,’ rather than as an impudent challenge.</p>
                    <p>What Are You Afraid Of? Another way of looking at it is that you’re picking a license based on what you are afraid of. All of these licenses assume you’re afraid of being sued. The MIT license is if you’re afraid no one will use your code; you’re making the licensing as short and non-intimidating as possible. The Apache License you are somewhat afraid of no one using your code, but you are also afraid of legal ambiguity and patent trolls. With the GPL licenses, you are afraid of someone else profiting from your work (and ambiguity, and patent trolls). This is a radical simplification, but if nothing else it can be a helpful framework in discussing with your attorney what license makes sense for your software.</p>

                    <p>Shaving off an instruction or two was almost an obsession with them. McCarthy compared these students to ski bums.

                    <p>The hacker ethic that played such a large part in advancing computer science, building gcc, building Linux, indeed building the world's computer systems and engineering the biggest peaceful economic boom in history, is more than just a thirst for knowledge about computers. It's the obsessive belief that knowledge exists to be shared, that helping someone by making their computer run better (or their air conditioner) is one of life's joys, and that the rules that prevent sharing and helping exist to be broken. [...] The hero is the one who knows how to fix things, and fixes them -- despite not being "authorized." The evil is the paperwork we construct around ourselves, the forms and regulations that take the place of people freely helping each other.</p>
                    <p>Next time your boss comes to you and asks "Can't you just...?" Stop. Think about what he just asked. Your boss is managing complexity and he doesn't even know it, and he's just described the interface he wants. Before you dismiss him as asking for the impossible, at least consider whether or not you could arrange things so that it looks like you're doing the really simple thing he's asking for, rather than making it obvious to all your users that you're doing the really complex thing that you have to do to achieve what he asked for. You know that's what you're doing, but you don't have to share your pain with people who don't know or care about the underlying complexity.</p>
                    <p>The fact is, your brain is built to do Perl programming. You have a deep desire to turn the complex into the simple, and Perl is just another tool to help you do that--just as I am using English right now to try to simplify reality. I can use English for that because English is a mess. This is important, and a little hard to understand. English is useful because it's a mess. Since English is a mess, it maps well onto the problem space, which is also a mess, which we call reality. Similarly, Perl was designed to be a mess (though in the nicest of possible ways).</p>

                    <p>Finally, although the subject is not a pleasant one, I must mention PL/1, a programming language for which the defining documentation is of a frightening size and complexity. Using PL/1 must be like flying a plane with 7000 buttons, switches and handles to manipulate in the cockpit. I absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the programming language —our basic tool, mind you!— already escapes our intellectual control.</p>
                    <p>Argument three is based on the constructive approach to the problem of program correctness. Today a usual technique is to make a program and then to test it. But: program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence. The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness. But one should not first make the program and then prove its correctness, because then the requirement of providing the proof would only increase the poor programmer’s burden. On the contrary: the programmer should let correctness proof and program grow hand in hand. Argument three is essentially based on the following observation. If one first asks oneself what the structure of a convincing proof would be and, having found this, then constructs a program satisfying this proof’s requirements, then these correctness concerns turn out to be a very effective heuristic guidance. By definition this approach is only applicable when we restrict ourselves to intellectually manageable programs, but it provides us with effective means for finding a satisfactory one among these.</p>
                    <p>We all know that the only mental tool by means of which a very finite piece of reasoning can cover a myriad cases is called “abstraction”; as a result the effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a competent programmer. In this connection it might be worth-while to point out that the purpose of abstracting is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.</p>
                    <p>The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.</p>

                    <p>Open Source Won the Battle, But Lost the War... a larger share of computing is performed by fixed function products, where the ability to modify the product is not part of the value proposition for the customer. Now ironically, open source has flourished in these fixed function devices, but more often than not, the benefits of those freedoms being realized more by those making the products rather than end users (which actually was true of the software market even back then: Microsoft was a big consumer of open source software, but their customers were not). Similarly, one could argue that open source has struggled more in the general purpose desktop space than anywhere else, but as the web and cloud computing has grown, desktop computing has increasingly been used for a narrower purpose (primarily running a browser), with the remaining functions running in the cloud (ironically, primarily on open source platforms). In short: open source does really own the general purpose computing space, but the market has become more sophisticated.

                    <p>Meanwhile, the GPL has legally enforced a consortia on major commercial companies. Red Hat, Novell, IBM, and many others are all contributing, and feel safe in doing so because the others are legally required to do the same. It's basically created a "safe" zone of cooperation, without anyone having to sign complicated legal documents. A company can't feel safe contributing code to the BSDs, because its competitors might simply copy it without reciprocating. There's much more corporate cooperation in the GPL'ed kernel code than with the BSD'd kernel code. Which means that in practice, it's actually been the GPL that's most "business-friendly". So while the BSDs have lost energy every time a company gets involved, the GPL'ed programs gain almost every time a company gets involved. And that explains it all.</p>

                    <p>The construction of software should be an engineering discipline. However, this doesn’t preclude individual craftsmanship. Think about the large cathedrals built in Europe during the Middle Ages. Each took thousands of person-years of effort, spread over many decades. Lessons learned were passed down to the next set of builders, who advanced the state of structural engineering with their accomplishments. But the carpenters, stonecutters, carvers, and glass workers were all craftspeople, interpreting the engineering requirements to produce a whole that transcended the purely mechanical side of the construction. It was their belief in their individual contributions that sustained the projects: We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals. (Quarry worker’s creed).</p>

                    <p>Lopatin’s own interests lay in filmmaking, and later, music journalism, but his parents’ experience with musical and creative censorship while behind the Iron Curtain would help inform his contextual, resourced approach to creating electronic music as OPN later on. “Music was rare and very special to them,” he remembers. “My dad has absolutely crazy stories about trading vodka for the microphone that a trolley driver uses to announce stops and then converting it for band practice, or listening to bootleg records pressed on X-rays.

                    <p>Years ago, anthropologist Margaret Mead was asked by a student what she considered to be the first sign of civilization in a culture. The student expected Mead to talk about fishhooks or clay pots or grinding stones. But no. Mead said that the first sign of civilization in an ancient culture was a femur (thighbone) that had been broken and then healed. Mead explained that in the animal kingdom, if you break your leg, you die. You cannot run from danger, get to the river for a drink or hunt for food. You are meat for prowling beasts. No animal survives a broken leg long enough for the bone to heal. A broken femur that has healed is evidence that someone has taken time to stay with the one who fell, has bound up the wound, has carried the person to safety and has tended the person through recovery. Helping someone else through difficulty is where civilization starts, Mead said." We are at our best when we serve others. Be civilized.</p>

                    <p>Multics Emacs proved to be a great success — programming new editing commands was so convenient that even the secretaries in his office started learning how to use it. They used a manual someone had written which showed how to extend Emacs, but didn't say it was a programming. So the secretaries, who believed they couldn't do programming, weren't scared off. They read the manual, discovered they could do useful things and they learned to program. So Bernie saw that an application — a program that does something useful for you — which has Lisp inside it and which you could extend by rewriting the Lisp programs, is actually a very good way for people to learn programming. It gives them a chance to write small programs that are useful for them, which in most arenas you can't possibly do. They can get encouragement for their own practical use — at the stage where it's the hardest — where they don't believe they can program, until they get to the point where they are programmers.</p>

                    <p>Finally there came in the mail an invitation from the Institute for Advanced Study: Einstein…von Neumann…Wyl…all these great minds! They write to me, and invite me to be a professor there! And not just a regular professor. Somehow they knew my feelings about the Institute: how it’s too theoretical; how there’s not enough real activity and challenge. So they write, “We appreciate that you have a considerable interest in experiments and in teaching, so we have made arrangements to create a special type of professorship, if you wish: half professor at Princeton University, and half at the Institute.”<br>Institute for Advanced Study! Special exception! A position better than Einstein, even! It was ideal; it was perfect; it was absurd!<br>It was absurd. The other offers had made me feel worse, up to a point. They were expecting me to accomplish something. But this offer was so ridiculous, so impossible for me ever to live up to, so ridiculously out of proportion. The other ones were just mistakes; this was an absurdity! I laughed at it while I was shaving, thinking about it.<br>And then I thought to myself, “You know, what they think of you is so fantastic, it’s impossible to live up to it. You have no responsibility to live up to it!”<br>It was a brilliant idea: You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It’s their mistake, not my failing.<br>It wasn’t a failure on my part that the Institute for Advanced Study expected me to be that good; it was impossible. It was clearly a mistake—and the moment I appreciated the possibility that they might be wrong, I realized that it was also true of all the other places, including my own university. I am what I am, and if they expected me to be good and they’re offering me some money for it, it’s their hard luck.</p>

                    <p>One thing to keep in mind when looking at GNU programs is that they're often intentionally written in an odd style to remove all questions of Unix copyright infringement at the time that they were written. The long-standing advice when writing GNU utilities used to be that if the program you were replacing was optimized for minimizing CPU use, write yours to minimize memory use, or vice-versa. Or in this case, if the program was optimized for simplicity, optimize for throughput.</p>

					you must save the Author.</p>
					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I wish it was as easy for others to have such satisfaction these days.<br>
					&gt;&gt;Amen to that.  I think we all lived, you Bell Labs people especially, in a simpler time.  We were trying to fit into 64K, split I/D 128K, my Z80 was 64K but some extra for graphics, then the VAX came and we were trying for 1MB, Suns with 4MB.
					So small mattered a lot and that meant the Unix philosophy of do one thing and do it well worked quite nicely.
					What that also meant, to people coming on a little bit after, was that it was relatively easy to modify stuff, the stuff was not that complex. Even I had an easy time, my prime was back at Sun when SunOS was a uniprocessor OS.  That is dramatically simpler than a fully threaded SMP OS that has support for TCP offloading, NUMA, etc, etc. I really don't know how systems people do it these days, it is a much more complex world. So I'm with Norm, it was fun back in the day to be able to come in and have a big impact.  I too wish that it was as easy for young people to come in and have that impact.  I've done that and it was awesome, these days, I have no idea how I'd make a difference.<br>
					&gt;By doing something besides systems. There are tons of open source projects at the user level that make a difference. Consider something like AsciiDoc.  Less than 10 years old (methinks), and in use for production by at least one major technical publisher that I know of. (And it sure beats the pants off of DocBook XML.) Or the work I do on gawk, Chet on Bash, other GNU bits. There's a whole world out there besides just the kernel.</p>
					<p>Rules, guidelines, and principles are gems of distilled experience that should be studied and respected. But they’re never a substute for thinking critically about your work.</p>
					<p>The other way, which is actually a really meaningful thing to me, and it’s super super subtle, is that I included a fast-forward button, so you can fast forward the music, you can skip to the next track, et cetera. But the subtle part is that, when you press the fast-forward button, you have changed the playback speed of the piece of music, but the random-number generator is moving ahead at the same rate. And so, the result of that is that you’ve now offset the music a little bit from the random sequence that it would have gotten had you not pressed that button. And, so you are suddenly getting an entirely new version of the piece. It sounds pretty much identical, because I use randomness in this textural level in the sound synthesis. It’s not like it has any control at the actual musical level. But the philosophical side of it is that if you never press the fast-forward button, then it’s this closed computational system, and it’s basically output-only. You know, you’re turning on the chip, the code starts running and it’s this closed system that mirrors some basic number theory. And the moment you press the button, then you’ve kind of interjected in this pure closed system, and you’ve brought in all of the messiness of the real world — like whether or not our time and space is grid-based on the lowest level, or whether or not we have free will, or where randomness comes in in quantum mechanics. All of these messy real world things suddenly come into the system and it’s no longer this clean abstract thing. And so, for me, what that also means is that the work of mathematicians, like Alan Turing and Kurt Gödel, these people who really explored the limits of computation, and the limits of mathematics, really — their work in applicable until you press the fast-forward button. It’s applicable so long as this is a deterministic system, and you kind of kill that determinism when you press the fast-forward button. So I think of that as, like, playing the piece.</p>
					<p>And like the wooden boat, Morse code gives us a link with the past. The old salts of radio are out there, still pounding the brass, and willing to chat with anyone who makes a credible effort to enter their world.<br>I travel with a small radio that fits into an old laptop computer bag. I'll throw a wire out the hotel window, slip on my headphones, dim the room lights, and see what's coming in. Sometimes I'll hear weak signals with exotic distortions picked up in the ionosphere as the waves crossed the equator or bounced over the pole. I feel lightning bolts jump from my fingers when I squeeze the key to send my own thoughts back the other way.<br>Sometimes I'll hear the crisp clean signal of an A-1 operator, probably a retired operator, probably living in Phoenix and having trouble sleeping. Once for them code unlocked adventure. They traveled the world keeping in touch with dits and dahs. They make it sound like poetry. I like to meet these guys by radio. In code they don't seem so old.</p>

                    <p>What's interesting is that at the same time that we were doing AWK, there was a project at Xerox PARC called ... Poplar ... which had fairly similar goals. That is, they were going to take these files consisting of a lot of characters and you break them apart in various ways and you process them using some language and you pass them on. And they put a lot of work into clever ideas. It was a functional programming language. Which was ... especially then a big deal, now it's less of a big deal. And it was supposed to be user friendly ... They had all sorts of stuff. And AWK lived and Poplar died. And I don't know, you know, this has affected my view about people who talk about user interfaces fairly severely. I'm no longer convinced anybody knows anything about user interface. It's clear some things are easier to use and some things are harder to use. That's okay. But it's also clear that people, people learn a lot. ... although AWK s language is both C-like and not real elegant, a lot of AWK programming isn't done by getting the reference manual and writing code. What is done is by finding some AWK program that's very similar to what you want to do and changing it, okay? And then the fact that it's a little weird isn't so bad. It's, you know what you're just changing. AWK lives partly, I think, because of its programming by example.</p>

                    <p>I think I was here two years before I understood anything Ken said. Because if you ask Ken a question, he sort of gives you a one line answer to the question he thinks you ought to have asked approximately. I don't know what he thinks he's doing, but that's certainly what it seemed to be like he was doing. And you have to know a lot to understand a one line answer to these things. And after a while the answers become extremely informative. But it really took a long time before I just understood anything Ken was saying.</p>

                    <p>I think almost every experienced programmer has gone through three stages and some go through four:<br>
					Cowboy coders or nuggets know little to nothing about design and view it as an unnecessary formality. If working on small projects for non-technical stakeholders, this attitude may serve them well for a while; it Gets Things Done, it impresses the boss, makes the programmer feel good about himself and confirms the idea that he knows what he's doing (even though he doesn't).<br>
					Architecture Astronauts have witnessed the failures of their first ball-of-yarn projects to adapt to changing circumstances. Everything must be rewritten and to prevent the need for another rewrite in the future, they create inner platforms, and end up spending 4 hours a day on support because nobody else understands how to use them properly.
					Quasi-engineers often mistake themselves for actual, trained engineers because they are genuinely competent and understand some engineering principles. They're aware of the underlying engineering and business concepts: Risk, ROI, UX, performance, maintainability, and so on. These people see design and documentation as a continuum and are usually able to adapt the level of architecture/design to the project requirements.<br>
					At this point, many fall in love with methodologies, whether they be Agile, Waterfall, RUP, etc. They start believing in the absolute infallibility and even necessity of these methodologies without realizing that in the actual software engineering field, they're merely tools, not religions. And unfortunately, it prevents them from ever getting to the final stage, which is:<br>
					Duct tape programmers AKA gurus or highly-paid consultants know what architecture and design they're going to use within five minutes after hearing the project requirements. All of the architecture and design work is still happening, but it's on an intuitive level and happening so fast that an untrained observer would mistake it for cowboy coding - and many do.<br>
					Generally these people are all about creating a product that's "good enough" and so their works may be a little under-engineered but they are miles away from the spaghetti code produced by cowboy coders. Nuggets cannot even identify these people when they're told about them, because to them, everything that is happening in the background just doesn't exist.<br>
					Some of you will probably be thinking to yourselves at this point that I haven't answered the question. That's because the question itself is flawed. Cowboy coding isn't a choice, it's a skill level, and you can't choose to be a cowboy coder any more than you can choose to be illiterate.<br>
					If you are a cowboy coder, then you know no other way.<br>
					If you've become an architecture astronaut, you are physically and psychologically incapable of producing software with no design.<br>
					If you are a quasi-engineer (or a professional engineer), then completing a project with little or no up-front design effort is a conscious choice (usually due to absurd deadlines) that has to be weighed against the obvious risks, and undertaken only after the stakeholders have agreed to them (usually in writing).<br>
					And if you are a duct-tape programmer, then there is never any reason to "cowboy code" because you can build a quality product just as quickly.</p>
					<p>One thing you have to be careful about, though, is that duct tape programmers are the software world equivalent of pretty boys… those breathtakingly good-looking young men who can roll out of bed, without shaving, without combing their hair, and without brushing their teeth, and get on the subway in yesterday’s dirty clothes and look beautiful, because that’s who they are. You, my friend, cannot go out in public without combing your hair. It will frighten the children. Because you’re just not that pretty.</p>
					<p>Hackers don't write documentation, or plan out their programming, instead they write Manifestos.</p>
                    <p>"Hypergrunge" was more specific, because a lot of the peripheral ideas about this record are like very directly dealing with observations in the music industry, and grunge is like, an insane thing, because it's a fallacy, it's totally fabricated. All grunge is hypergrunge. It's been synthesized by all of these marketing factors. You know about grunge speak? Or the story of grunge speak? There was a secretary at the Sub Pop office in the '90s, she was always getting interviewed because journalists would just come in and be like "So, what's grunge?" And she got sick of it, and she started tricking them or lying to them, like "Yeah, there's a whole language to grunge, dude." And she made up all these words that were like, grunge speak. [The New York Times] went and published this thing that she tricked them with, and I was so inspired by that.</p>

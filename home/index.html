                    To justify this page, I'll first have to explain a bit about myself. I'm a person, which means we're likely similar in that respect, but the thing about me is that I probably have more tabs open than you. That's right -- as of right now I have about (let's see... <i>*intense arithmetic ensues*</i>) six windows open, with each containing around 30 - 50 tabs. Each of those tabs has valuable information which I simply don't have to time to read, mostly because I'm busy opening more tabs. <i>Note: Due to a freak accident, I've lost the majority of these tabs to the void :-(</i>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Seriously though, I've found some pretty cool stuff on my quest as an online trashman, and I'd like to share it. Thus, I will now birth this page with my very fingertips, partly out of boredom, and partly out of necessity as I need to find a sustainable and organized way of storing my information. I hope you find something interesting! Good luck digging.

                    Note 2: This page looks like this on purpose. In this version of reality overrun by GUIs, JavaScript and the like, it's easy to forget about the most important part of your web page -- the content. If you go to the homepage of my site [as of 4/2019] you'll see a giant animated CSS dog which has nothing to do with my website. I'm a victim! Cool stuff looks cool, but it's important to not lose sight of the purpose of your project. Thus, maintaining this page will allow me to practice discipline and to keep HTML and CSS separated, as 'mechanism' and 'policy' should be separate.

                    Much like everything else in life, CS didn't appear out of thin air. I seldom come across anyone interested in the culture and history of Computer Science and its subgroups, which is sad and kind of strange. The public view of CS seems to paint it as an ultra-practical skillset and a pathway to economic success. Perhaps this is a symptom of the divide between STEM and the humanities, or the inevitable side effect of Late Capitalism. Either way, to the layman, this rich history is virtually unknown, and Computer Science seems to be boiled down to the technical sum of its parts.

                    <p>No Silver Bullet</p>
                    <p>We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.</p>
                    <p> Anti-pattern </p>
                    <p> Today science is biased towards rejecting any theory involving God. It is called naturalism. It proposes that any and all observable phenomena must have a natural cause. It also has the side-effect of barring God from having any influence in the world. If it appears that God has an influence in the world, a different explanation must be found. And men are masters of creating alternative explanations. It is called skepticism.</p>
                    <p> Playing over these moves is an eerie experience. They are not human; a grandmaster does not understand them any better than someone who has learned chess yesterday. The knights jump, the kings orbit, the sun goes down, and every move is the truth. It's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but it's in Estonian. </p>
                    <p>Education is an extension of the human instinct to reproduce. One of the things we should be doing is to purposely invent better ways to think, and then figure out how to teach them to children to create much more able adults than we are.</p>
                    <p>Anyone can cook, but only the fearless can be great</p>

                    <p>From soup to nuts</p>
                    <p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.</p>
                    <p>Most Non-Unix managers conclude that VI is either extraterrestrial in origin or was devised by the original Unix developers as part of a secret communications code to reach another dimension.</p>

                    <p>The moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself.</p>
                    <p>im 86 years old, and, uh, im in the bathtub with two crocodiles, they're like pet crocodiles, cause real crocodiles have gone extinct, so they're like small and pink, and they're crawling all over me, im drinking nice, moroccan coffee, and im listening to old chief keef demos, and just like, beautiful, women everywhere, exotic pets, and i don't know i go down and check the mail</p>

                    <p>In the 80s and 90s, engineers built complex systems by combining simple and well-understood parts. The goal of SICP was to provide the abstraction language for reasoning about such systems. Today, this is no longer the case. Engineers now routinely write code for complicated hardware that they don’t fully understand (and often can’t understand because of trade secrecy.) The same is true at the software level, since programming environments consist of gigantic libraries with enormous functionality. Programming today is “More like science. You grab this piece of library and you poke at it. You write programs that poke it and see what it does. And you say, ‘Can I tweak it to do the thing I want?'”. The “analysis-by-synthesis” view of SICP — where you build a larger system out of smaller, simple parts — became irrelevant. Nowadays, we do programming by poking.</p>
                    <p>I have no idea if other fields have this same problem — my guess is that physicists are particularly prone to it, since we are trained early on to think that physicists are simply smarter than chemists or biologists. Those other fields are for the hard workers. We don’t put mathemeticians on this scale, because we secretly believe they’re smarter than us. Note to the biologist lynch mob: tounge is in cheek.)</p>
                    <p>Enjoy your work</p>
                    <p>ex nihilo nihil fit</p>
                    <p>one should base one’s work satisfaction on realistic achievements, such as advancing the state of knowledge in one’s specialty, improving one’s understanding of a field, or communicating this understanding successfully to others, rather than basing it on exceptionally rare events, such as spectacularly solving a major open problem, or achieving major recognition from one’s peers.</p>
                    <p>There is no royal way to geometry</p>
                    <p>we should be getting as much baloney as possible out of our own sandwiches.</p>
                    <p>after cultivating the right habits around doing nothing, you can actually obtain animal consciousness where you do not desire to do things.</p>
                    <p>Everybody writes a screen editor. It's easy to do and makes them feel important. Tell them to work on something useful.</p>

                    <p>What you do need is some amount of time spent on the idea that computer programs are mathematical objects which can be reasoned about mathematically. This is the part that the vast majority of people are missing nowadays, and it can be a little tricky to wrap your brain around at first.</p>
                    <p>of course it runs NetBSD</p>
                    <p>Ken Thompson was once asked what he would do differently if he were redesigning the UNIX system. His reply: "I'd spell creat with an e."</p>

                    <p>C is a Spartan language, and so should your naming be. Unlike Modula-2 and Pascal programmers, C programmers do not use cute names like ThisVariableIsATemporaryCounter. A C programmer would call that variable tmp, which is much easier to write, and not the least more difficult to understand.</p>
                    <p>free software without any warrant but with best wishes</p>
                    <p>Why don't you tell us what you are attempting to accomplish and perhaps we can suggest an easier way to "skin this cat".</p>
                    <p>I find it bizarre that people use the term "coding" to mean programming. For decades, we used the word "coding" for the work of low-level staff in a business programming team. The designer would write a detailed flow chart, then the "coders" would write code to implement the flow chart. This is quite different from what we did and do in the hacker community -- with us, one person designs the program and writes its code as a single activity. When I developed GNU programs, that was programming, but it was definitely not coding. Since I don't think the recent fad for "coding" is an improvement, I have decided not to adopt it. I don't use the term "coding", except if I were talking about a business programming team which has coders.</p>

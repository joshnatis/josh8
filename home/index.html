                    Welcome to my humble abode. I've become something of an online trashman over the past few years -- I often stumble upon information that I don't want to lose, so I organize it here for my convenience (and maybe yours too, dig around maybe you'll find something cool). This is also a place to commemorate people who I admire. I like to humanize the gurus and legendary personas that I read and hear about. I find that birthdays help with this -- did you know that Ken Thompson and I almost share a birthday!? Have a good stay.

                    Note 0: This page looks like this on purpose. In this version of reality overrun by GUIs, JavaScript and the like, it's easy to forget about the most important part of your web page -- the content. If you go to the homepage of my site [as of 4/2019] you'll see a giant animated CSS dog which has nothing to do with my website. I'm a victim! Cool stuff looks cool, but it's important to not lose sight of the purpose of your project. Thus, maintaining this page will allow me to practice discipline and to keep HTML and CSS separated, as 'mechanism' and 'policy' should be separate.

                    Much like everything else in life, CS didn't appear out of thin air. I seldom come across anyone interested in the culture and history of Computer Science and its subgroups, which is sad and kind of strange. The public view of CS seems to paint it as an ultra-practical skillset and a pathway to economic success. Perhaps this is a symptom of the divide between STEM and the humanities, or the inevitable side effect of Late Capitalism. Either way, to the layman, this rich history is virtually unknown, and Computer Science seems to be boiled down to the technical sum of its parts.

                    <p><p> Playing over these moves is an eerie experience. They are not human; a grandmaster does not understand them any better than someone who has learned chess yesterday. The knights jump, the kings orbit, the sun goes down, and every move is the truth. It's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but it's in Estonian. </p>
                    <p> Today science is biased towards rejecting any theory involving God. It is called naturalism. It proposes that any and all observable phenomena must have a natural cause. It also has the side-effect of barring God from having any influence in the world. If it appears that God has an influence in the world, a different explanation must be found. And men are masters of creating alternative explanations. It is called skepticism.</p>
                    <p>Education is an extension of the human instinct to reproduce. One of the things we should be doing is to purposely invent better ways to think, and then figure out how to teach them to children to create much more able adults than we are.</p>

                    <p>In the 80s and 90s, engineers built complex systems by combining simple and well-understood parts. The goal of SICP was to provide the abstraction language for reasoning about such systems. Today, this is no longer the case. Engineers now routinely write code for complicated hardware that they don’t fully understand (and often can’t understand because of trade secrecy.) The same is true at the software level, since programming environments consist of gigantic libraries with enormous functionality. Programming today is “More like science. You grab this piece of library and you poke at it. You write programs that poke it and see what it does. And you say, ‘Can I tweak it to do the thing I want?'”. The “analysis-by-synthesis” view of SICP — where you build a larger system out of smaller, simple parts — became irrelevant. Nowadays, we do programming by poking.</p>
                    <p>I have no idea if other fields have this same problem — my guess is that physicists are particularly prone to it, since we are trained early on to think that physicists are simply smarter than chemists or biologists. Those other fields are for the hard workers. We don’t put mathemeticians on this scale, because we secretly believe they’re smarter than us. Note to the biologist lynch mob: tounge is in cheek.)</p>

                    <p>What you do need is some amount of time spent on the idea that computer programs are mathematical objects which can be reasoned about mathematically. This is the part that the vast majority of people are missing nowadays, and it can be a little tricky to wrap your brain around at first.</p>

                    <p>C is a Spartan language, and so should your naming be. Unlike Modula-2 and Pascal programmers, C programmers do not use cute names like ThisVariableIsATemporaryCounter.

                    <p>I find it bizarre that people use the term "coding" to mean programming. For decades, we used the word "coding" for the work of low-level staff in a business programming team. The designer would write a detailed flow chart, then the "coders" would write code to implement the flow chart. This is quite different from what we did and do in the hacker community -- with us, one person designs the program and writes its code as a single activity. When I developed GNU programs, that was programming, but it was definitely not coding. Since I don't think the recent fad for "coding" is an improvement, I have decided not to adopt it. I don't use the term "coding", except if I were talking about a business programming team which has coders.</p>

                    <p>People often miss this, or even deny it, but there are many examples of object-oriented programming in the kernel. Although the kernel developers may shun C++ and other explicitly object-oriented languages, thinking in terms of objects is often useful. The VFS [Virtual File System] is a good example of how to do clean and efficient OOP in C, which is a language that lacks any OOP constructs</p>
                    <p><i>Thompson</i>: One day I got this idea -- pipes, essentially exactly as they are today. I put them in the operating system in an hour -- they're trivial, they really are super trivial when you've got redirecting IO like UNIX already had. 
                    
					The idea was just mind blowing to us. Dennis and I came in and rewrote everything in the world -- our world, in one night. We converted everything. Mostly what we did was throw out extraneous messages. Like, sort would never say "hey I'm sorting, I'm merging, I'm doing this, I'm working on this file". All that garbage is gone -- sort would read, sort, then write. And suddenly sort was what we'd call a "filter" in that day. Then we converted everything that processed something into filters. It was massive, and just exciting. 
					<br>
					<i>Kernighan:</i> And the world changed, essentially overnight.
					</p>
					<p><i>Thompson</i>: I've always been interested in chess, I played it when I was in 7th grade because that's when Bobby Fischer was right at his height. Bobby Fischer and I are like 10 years apart in age, except that he's dead. So, I would come home and on the cover of Life Magazine there'd be "Bobby Fischer". And here I am, exactly the same age, and what do I do? So I felt very very, I don't know, worthless. I joined the chess club and played chess in school, and was good at it, but I didn't like it. I didn't like to win -- because you feel sorry for somebody who'd take it seriously, and I didn't like to lose of course. And that cut down on my options.</p>
                    <p>In order to do evil things like convert raw bytes to floats, I chose to use the “unsafe” package, which made me feel manly, powerful, and highly supportive of private gun ownership.</p>
                    <p>A mathematician’s distance from the center of his universe is often measured by Erdős number − how many degrees of coauthorship separate him and the legendary Paul Erdős. It has been my good fortune to snag a Ritchie-Thompson number of one. </p>

                    <p>The majority of ordinary people want to live a peaceful life. In fact, the people who are the most determined to live a peaceful and calm life are constantly running into capitalism as an insurmountable obstacle to living it. Every single day we're pushed aside, pushed at the job, we're put under all kinds of pressure in the family and society -- anywhere we go in capitalist society, which impedes on our very modest wish to live a perfectly ordinary, non-eventful and harmonious life. Because of the pressures the crisis of capitalism puts on these people, you see that the people who are most determined to live a normal and tranquil life are pushed towards drawing more and more radical and revolutionary ideas, contrary to their wishes. And that in fact is the driving force of all revolutions.</p>
                    <p>To be a Hegelian is to have a big stomach. You've got the whole world in thought. That's how we understand someone like Zizek -- he's got a very big philosophical stomach... there's nothing he can't digest.</p>
                    <p>You are Not Expected to Understand This</p>
                    <p>‘You are not expected to understand this’ was intended as a remark in the spirit of ‘This won’t be on the exam,’ rather than as an impudent challenge.</p>
                    <p>What Are You Afraid Of? Another way of looking at it is that you’re picking a license based on what you are afraid of. All of these licenses assume you’re afraid of being sued. The MIT license is if you’re afraid no one will use your code; you’re making the licensing as short and non-intimidating as possible. The Apache License you are somewhat afraid of no one using your code, but you are also afraid of legal ambiguity and patent trolls. With the GPL licenses, you are afraid of someone else profiting from your work (and ambiguity, and patent trolls). This is a radical simplification, but if nothing else it can be a helpful framework in discussing with your attorney what license makes sense for your software.</p>

                    <p>Shaving off an instruction or two was almost an obsession with them. McCarthy compared these students to ski bums. They got the same kind of primal thrill from “maximizing code” as fanatic skiers got from swooshing frantically down a hill. So the practice of taking a computer program and trying to cut off instructions without affecting the outcome came to be called “program bumming"</p>

                    <p>The hacker ethic that played such a large part in advancing computer science, building gcc, building Linux, indeed building the world's computer systems and engineering the biggest peaceful economic boom in history, is more than just a thirst for knowledge about computers. It's the obsessive belief that knowledge exists to be shared, that helping someone by making their computer run better (or their air conditioner) is one of life's joys, and that the rules that prevent sharing and helping exist to be broken. [...] The hero is the one who knows how to fix things, and fixes them -- despite not being "authorized." The evil is the paperwork we construct around ourselves, the forms and regulations that take the place of people freely helping each other.</p>
                    <p>Next time your boss comes to you and asks "Can't you just...?" Stop. Think about what he just asked. Your boss is managing complexity and he doesn't even know it, and he's just described the interface he wants. Before you dismiss him as asking for the impossible, at least consider whether or not you could arrange things so that it looks like you're doing the really simple thing he's asking for, rather than making it obvious to all your users that you're doing the really complex thing that you have to do to achieve what he asked for. You know that's what you're doing, but you don't have to share your pain with people who don't know or care about the underlying complexity.</p>
                    <p>The fact is, your brain is built to do Perl programming. You have a deep desire to turn the complex into the simple, and Perl is just another tool to help you do that--just as I am using English right now to try to simplify reality. I can use English for that because English is a mess. This is important, and a little hard to understand. English is useful because it's a mess. Since English is a mess, it maps well onto the problem space, which is also a mess, which we call reality. Similarly, Perl was designed to be a mess (though in the nicest of possible ways).</p>
                    <p>Our variable and function naming convention is to match the surrounding code. For example, if you see that variables use a CamelCase style, match that. If they use underscores, or are lowercase, match that. Readability and consistency within a section of code is of greater importance than universal consistency.</p>

                    <p>I hate complexity. I tolerate it when there is no other way, but as my math kids say, if you have the right answer, it is beautiful and simple. Complex is reserved for when you haven't figured it out yet.</p>

                    <p>Finally, although the subject is not a pleasant one, I must mention PL/1, a programming language for which the defining documentation is of a frightening size and complexity. Using PL/1 must be like flying a plane with 7000 buttons, switches and handles to manipulate in the cockpit. I absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the programming language —our basic tool, mind you!— already escapes our intellectual control.</p>
                    <p>Argument three is based on the constructive approach to the problem of program correctness. Today a usual technique is to make a program and then to test it. But: program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence. The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness. But one should not first make the program and then prove its correctness, because then the requirement of providing the proof would only increase the poor programmer’s burden. On the contrary: the programmer should let correctness proof and program grow hand in hand. Argument three is essentially based on the following observation. If one first asks oneself what the structure of a convincing proof would be and, having found this, then constructs a program satisfying this proof’s requirements, then these correctness concerns turn out to be a very effective heuristic guidance. By definition this approach is only applicable when we restrict ourselves to intellectually manageable programs, but it provides us with effective means for finding a satisfactory one among these.</p>
                    <p>We all know that the only mental tool by means of which a very finite piece of reasoning can cover a myriad cases is called “abstraction”; as a result the effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a competent programmer. In this connection it might be worth-while to point out that the purpose of abstracting is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.</p>
                    <p>The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.</p>

You can use it as a stricter C, as a C with some syntactic support of ADTs, as C++98-style OO, or as a C++17 style meta-programming system.  And I’ve probably missed a few. The resulting complexity requires a lot of discipline to use successfully, especially in a large team.</p>

                    <p>During the 1970s, when structured programming was introduced, Harlan Mills pointed out that the programming team should be organized like a surgical team--one surgeon and his or her assistants, not like a hog butchering team--give everybody an axe and let them chop away.</p>

                    <p>Open Source Won the Battle, But Lost the War... a larger share of computing is performed by fixed function products, where the ability to modify the product is not part of the value proposition for the customer. Now ironically, open source has flourished in these fixed function devices, but more often than not, the benefits of those freedoms being realized more by those making the products rather than end users (which actually was true of the software market even back then: Microsoft was a big consumer of open source software, but their customers were not). Similarly, one could argue that open source has struggled more in the general purpose desktop space than anywhere else, but as the web and cloud computing has grown, desktop computing has increasingly been used for a narrower purpose (primarily running a browser), with the remaining functions running in the cloud (ironically, primarily on open source platforms). In short: open source does really own the general purpose computing space, but the market has become more sophisticated.

With LIFE you’re the first guy there, and there’s always fun stuff going on.</p>

                    <p>Meritocracy was meant to be a satirical concept so clearly wrongheaded that nobody could think it was a good idea. There is no true meritocracy - there's only an arbitrarily chosen set of metrics that any given organisation considers to be of merit, and people who either benefit or lose out as a result of that specific choice. We don't understand community dynamics and the process of software development well enough to say with absolute certainty that a given set of metrics is objectively the correct measure, and as a result we cannot provide a meaningful definition of merit.</p>

                    <p>Gods of BSD</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the GPL has legally enforced a consortia on major commercial companies. Red Hat, Novell, IBM, and many others are all contributing, and feel safe in doing so because the others are legally required to do the same. It's basically created a "safe" zone of cooperation, without anyone having to sign complicated legal documents. A company can't feel safe contributing code to the BSDs, because its competitors might simply copy it without reciprocating. There's much more corporate cooperation in the GPL'ed kernel code than with the BSD'd kernel code. Which means that in practice, it's actually been the GPL that's most "business-friendly". So while the BSDs have lost energy every time a company gets involved, the GPL'ed programs gain almost every time a company gets involved. And that explains it all.</p>

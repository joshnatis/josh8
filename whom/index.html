				<h1 class="about-text" id="title1">Who's Josh?</h1>
				<p class="about-text">It must be me you're looking for :)
					<br>
					I'm Josh, a sophomore studying computer science at CUNY Hunter College. 
					<br><br>
					I love all aspects of computer science -- its history, its culture, programming, linguistic stuff, theoretical stuff, mathematical stuff, UNIX memorabilia, Brian Kernighan, low level stuff, high level stuff, and other stuff. I like to learn. I like to teach. I want to contribute to Open Source and make the world a better place (no, not talking about you Java). 
					<br><br>
					I also make <a href="https://josh8.com/tunes">music</a>, but it mostly sucks. I listen to music a lot, and that's <a href="https://youtu.be/gwKvIt504Y0">pretty good</a>. I'm in a relationship with my lovely girlfriend of almost 5 years now, <i>*Borat voice*, I laav her</i>. I like nature and hope to eventually help protect it and have more time to appreciate it. I have two cats; they're both hiding somewhere on YouTube from when I was 11 and wanted to be a Minecraft YouTuber. Do not forget to protect trees, elephants, tigers, and penguins.
					<br><br>
					I want to use up the rest of this stupid box, which I've aptly titled the "bureaucracy box". It's named after my "bureaucracy bar", seen above, which is my affectionate synonym for a navbar. The name alludes to the pattern of navbars and portfolio websites frequently encountered online, as well as the things they often carry with them -- the perversion of our humanity in exchange for a job, late capitalism, bureaucracy, and lifelessness. That's why the rest of my website looks the way it does (aside from not being a good web brogrammer). I reject this.
					<br><br>
					Love you, thanks for reading. â™¥

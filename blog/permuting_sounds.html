&#42;<i>record scratch</i>&#42;<br>&#42;<i>freeze frame</i>&#42;<br><br>Yup, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. <i>Shit wait, that meme doesn't really apply to this situation. Oh well.</i>
</p>

<p>
Before I get to discussing the namesake of this post, I want to provide some context.
</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>
 The image above comes from an "interactive story game" I was making as a project for one of my classes (a media class!). One part of the game involved choosing drum sounds, and sequencing them into a loop (the picture is of the latter). I then wanted to play the drum loop back to the user (along with a melodic counterpart).
</p>

<p>
Ok, how do I create a drum loop based on the user's input? The information I have available to me is:<br>(1) the filenames of the sounds (e.g. <i>kick1.mp3</i>, <i>snare3.mp3</i>, <i>hihat2.mp3</i>), and<br>(2) which notes are selected in each row (based on whether the background color is blue).
</p>

<h3> Take 1</h3>
<p>
My initial idea was to have a repository of every possible drum loop the user could make, and then I would simply return the name of the respective drum loop based on the user's input. Alright, so how many audio files is that?
</p>

<p>
<ins>Available sounds</ins>:<br>1 of <code class="inline-code">kick1.mp3, kick2.mp3, kick3.mp3</code>,<br>1 of <code class="inline-code">snare1.mp3, snare2.mp3, snare3.mp3</code>,<br>1 of <code class="inline-code">hihat1.mp3, hihat2.mp3, hihat3.mp3</code>
</p>

<p>
<ins>Positions for each sound</ins>: <code class="inline-code">8</code>
</p>

<p>
There are <code class="inline-code">256</code> ways we can arrange a single sound clip (e.g. <i>kick1.mp3</i>) in those 8 positions. Since there are 3 versions of each instrument, and 3 instruments in total, we'd need <code class="inline-code">(256 &#42; 3) &#42; 3 = 2304</code> files to capture every possible loop for each single sound. Here's what I mean:
</p>

<div style="display:inline-block; margin-left: 15%;"><i>Possible arrangements. Let k1 mean kick1.mp3, s2 mean snare2.mp3, and etc.</i>

<pre><code class="c">1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8
------------------------------------------------------------
k1  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |

k3  |	    |   k3  |   k3  |   k3  |       |   k3  |       |
... |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
s2  |	s2  | 	s2  | 	s2  |	s2  |       |       |       |
... |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
h3  |   h3  |   h3  |  h3   |  h3   |  h3   |  h3   |   h3  |
... |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |

<p>
Here's an example of the last row:<audio style="display: block; filter: sepia(20%) saturate(70%) grayscale(1) contrast(99%) invert(12%); width: 200px; height: 25px;" controls><source src="images/loop_sample.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio>
</p>

<p>
And an example of the second row:
</p>

<p>
<audio style="display: block; filter: sepia(20%) saturate(70%) grayscale(1) contrast(99%) invert(12%); width: 200px; height: 25px;" controls><source src="images/loop_sample2.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio>
</p>

</div>

<p>
The complete table would have 2304 rows in it. And, as you can see/hear, this only considers loops of a single instrument, not ones with all three elements. Can you smell the complexity? Each row can be combined with any other two rows (given that each row is a distinct instrument), which yields... a huge number, man. I don't even know how to calculate that.
</p>

<p>
Not to mention, I was arranging all of these loops by hand in a graphical environment:<br>
<br>
<img style="width:65%; margin-left: 15%; border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 5px;" alt="workflow 1" src="images/workflow.png">
</p>

<p>
<img style="width:65%; margin-left: 15% ;border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 5px;" alt="workflow 2" src="images/workflow2.png">|
</p>

<p>
Ok, so after about 15 minutes of creating files by hand I knew this would never work. What I did next was what any other sensible person would do -- I rang up my good friend <a href="https://nimatullo.com">mmvvpp123</a>.
</p>

<h3> Take 2</h3>

<p>
Mmvvpp123 recommended the file-less alternative of looping through all of the "notes" and playing them with JavaScript. This seemed like the right approach, but it did spook me a bit, as I was worried about the drums staying in sync with their accompanying melodies, and I had some uncertanties about how I would implement the process.
</p>

<p>
This may have been the most scalable and/or best approach, but I never got the chance to find out cause I went to go shower right after our call. Andddd, you know how showers are. By the time I was out, I had a whole plan figured out regarding how I could automate generating audio files.
</p>

<h3> Take 3</h3>

<p>
FFMPEG. I knew that FFMPEG is able to concatenate audio files -- what if I could create loops by concatenating the sounds together? There are 8 beats, each one will either have a sound or silence.
</p>

<p>
The syntax for doing this with FFMPEG is:
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i loop_sample2.txt -c copy loop_sample2.mp3
</code></pre>
<p>
<i>Contents of <code class="inline-code">loop_sample2.txt</code>:</i></p>

<pre><code class="c">file 'kick1.mp3'
file 'kick1.mp3'
file 'silence.mp3'
file 'silence.mp3'
file 'silence.mp3'
file 'silence.mp3'
file 'silence.mp3'
</code></pre>

<p>
(This knowledge comes via <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/314239/how-to-join-merge-many-mp3-files">Miles Wolbe on StackOverflow</a>)
</p>

<p>
All together, this yields <code class="inline-code">loop_sample2.mp3</code>, which is the audio file with two kicks you heard earlier in the post. This is text! This is automatable!
</p>

<h2> Solution</h2>

<p>
Buckle up kiddo, we're gonna go for a ride.
</p>

<p>
Remember those <code class="inline-code">2304</code> possible permutations I mentioned earlier? Let's generate all of them! We're going to need <code class="inline-code">2304</code> files, each with similar contents to the one above (different arrangements of 1 element from</p>

<pre><code class="">['kick1.mp3', 'kick2.mp3', 'kick3.mp3', 'snare1.mp3', 'snare2.mp3', 'snare3.mp3', 'hihat1.mp3', 'hihat2.mp3', 'hihat3.mp3']
</code></pre>
<p>
along with <code class="inline-code">'silence.mp3'</code>).
</p>

<p>
So, when it comes down to it, the problem is finding all the possible ways we can place 2 distinct elements into 8 spots. I chose to summarize that as generating every possible length-8 arrangement of <code class="inline-code">X</code> and <code class="inline-code">O</code>, such as <code class="inline-code">XXXXXXXX</code> or <code class="inline-code">OOOOOOOO</code> or <code class="inline-code">XOXOXOXO</code>. Once we do that, we can replace every <code class="inline-code">X</code> with a sound clip and every <code class="inline-code">O</code> with silence, and then write that to a file in FFMPEG's preferred format (seen above).
</p>

<p>
To generate this glorified Tic-Tac-Toe game, I pleaded for help on Discord, and also asked my friend <a href="https://rvente.com/">Blake</a>, who quickly got back to me with a Python one-liner:
</p>

<pre><code class="python3">for i in range(2**8):
        print(str(bin(i))[2:].zfill(8).replace("0","O").replace("1","X"))
</code></pre>

<p>
Ok maybe it's a two-liner, but it's still a one-liner in my heart. That produced <code class="inline-code">256</code> lines of <code class="inline-code">X</code>s and <code class="inline-code">O</code>s (cause as I mentioned there are <code class="inline-code">256</code> ways to arrange a sound clip in 8 spots). Each of these lines represents a potential drum loop.
</p>

<div style="display:inline-block; margin-left: 35%;"><i>Some sample output:</i>

<pre><code class="">OOXOOXOO
OOXOOXOX
OOXOOXXO
OOXOOXXX
OOXOXOOO
OOXOXOOX
OOXOXOXO
OOXOXOXX
OOXOXXOO
OOXOXXOX
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Now, we just have to generate a bunch of files for FFMPEG based on each line of this output. I elected to do this in C++, cause I'm comfy :3 with its IO libraries and I was just trying to get stuff done.
</p>

<p>
The meat of the work is simple, and done like this:</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">/* where "sound" is one of ['kick1.mp3', 'kick2.mp3', ... 'hat3.mp3'],
 "fout" is writing to a file, and "line" is the string of Xs and Os */
for(int i = 0; i &lt; line.size(); ++i)
{
	if(line[i] == 'X') fout &lt;&lt; "file '" &lt;&lt; sound &lt;&lt; "'\n";
	else if(line[i] == 'O') fout &lt;&lt; "file 'silence.mp3'\n";
}
</code></pre>
<p>
But, this raises the question of how we should name the files we're generating. I'll borrow a trick from the world of epsilon-delta proofs and work backwards for a second -- let's revisit how exactly our JavaScript program will know which file to fetch based on the user's entered drum sequence.
</p>

<h3> Building a Communication Protocol</h3>

<p>
Recall this image:
<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 5px;" alt="drum sequencer" src="images/sequencer.jpg">
</p>

<p>
We're going to parse this information to decide which filename each row corresponds to:
</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">//filename example: k1_45678.mp3
function generateFilename()
{
	//each note is a span element
	let notes = document.getElementsByTagName("SPAN");

	//where kick, snare, and hihat are file names such as "kick1.mp3"
	// (the user selected one of each type previously)
	let kick_num = kick[kick.indexOf(".") - 1];
	let snare_num = snare[snare.indexOf(".") - 1]; //e.g. 2
	let hat_num = hihat[hihat.indexOf(".") - 1];

	let kick_filename = "k" + kick_num + "_";
	let snare_filename = "s" + snare_num + "_"; //e.g. s2_
	let hat_filename = "h" + hat_num + "_";

	for(let i = 0; i &lt; 8; ++i)
		if(notes[i].style.backgroundColor == "blue") kick_filename += (i + 1);

	for(let i = 0; i &lt; 8; ++i)
		if(notes[8 + i].style.backgroundColor == "blue") snare_filename += (i + 1);

	for(let i = 0; i &lt; 8; ++i)
		if(notes[16 + i].style.backgroundColor == "blue") hat_filename += (i + 1);

	kick_filename += ".mp3";
	snare_filename += ".mp3";
	hat_filename += ".mp3";

	return [kick_filename, snare_filename, hat_filename];
}
</code></pre>

<p>
So basically the name format is:<br><br>(1) the first letter of the instrument type <i>(k/s/h)</i>, followed by<br>(2) the number of the instrument (as in kick1 vs kick2) <i>(1/2/3)</i>, followed by<br>(3) an underscore, then<br>(4) the positions of the notes <i>(1 through 8)</i><br><br> Yielding something like <i>k1_45678.mp3</i>.
</p>

<p>
We can then use this filename as the source for an audio element and play it back to the user (assuming we've pre-generated all of these files and are storing them somewhere).
</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">let kickloop = new Audio(kick_filename);
let snareloop = new Audio(snare_filename);
let hatloop = new Audio(hat_filename);

kickloop.play();
snareloop.play();
hatloop.play();
</code></pre>
<p>
Voila, now we know how to name our files for FFMPEG!
</p>

<h3> Tying Up Loose Ends: Montage</h3>
<p>
In other words, let's finish this up. We can now complete our C++ program, which (as a refresher) is cycling through each line of <code class="inline-code">X</code>s and <code class="inline-code">O</code>s and translating them into files that FFMPEG will use to create loops.
</p>

<pre><code class="cpp">#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
using namespace std;

// XXOOOOXO --&gt; 127
string rename(const string &amp;line)
{
        string name = "";
        for(int i = 0, l = line.length(); i &lt; l; ++i)
                if(line[i] == 'X') name += to_string(i + 1);
        return name;
}

// kick1.mp3 --&gt; 1
string getInstNum(const string &amp;inst)
{
	for(int i = 0, l = inst.length(); i &lt; l; ++i)
		if(inst[i] == '.') return string(1, inst[i-1]);
}

// reads input from stdin, call with "./a.out 'kick1.mp3'"
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        string inst = argv[1]; //e.g. kick1.mp3
        string prefix = inst[0] + getInstNum(inst); //e.g. k1

        ofstream fout;
        string line;
        while(getline(cin, line))
        {
                // create a file (e.g. k1_127.txt)
		fout.open(prefix + "_" + rename(line) + ".txt");

		// fill the file, properly formatting
		for(int i = 0, l = line.length(); i &lt; l; ++i)
                {
                        if(line[i] == 'X') fout &lt;&lt; "file '" &lt;&lt; inst &lt;&lt; "'\n";
                        else if(line[i] == 'O') fout &lt;&lt; "file 'silence.mp3'\n";
                }
                fout.close();
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
We provide the input for this program using Blake's beautiful Python one-liner from earlier, which I'll put into the file <code class="inline-code">loops.py</code>.
</p>

<p>
Calling:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">python3 loops.py | ./a.out 'kick1.mp3'
</code></pre>
<p>
Generates a bunch of files, such as:
</p>

<p>
<img alt="example output files" src="images/files.png">
</p>

<p>
Unix is magic. I guess we can simply do this by hand for all of our sounds, cause we only have 9:
</p>

<pre><code class="sh">python3 loops.py | ./a.out 'kick1.mp3'
python3 loops.py | ./a.out 'kick2.mp3'
python3 loops.py | ./a.out 'kick3.mp3'
python3 loops.py | ./a.out 'snare1.mp3'
python3 loops.py | ./a.out 'snare2.mp3'
python3 loops.py | ./a.out 'snare3.mp3'
python3 loops.py | ./a.out 'hihat1.mp3'
python3 loops.py | ./a.out 'hihat2.mp3'
python3 loops.py | ./a.out 'hihat3.mp3'
</code></pre>

<p>
And now we can finally invoke FFMPEG to stitch the sounds together and create our drum loops. We'll do that with a shell script:
</p>

<pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash
shopt -s nullglob

mkdir audio_files

for filename in ./*; do
        filename="${filename##*/}" # remove path
	name="${filename%%.*}"
        ext="${filename##*.}"
        if [ "$ext" = "txt" ]; then
                ffmpeg -f concat -i "$name" -c copy "$name".mp3
		mv "$name.mp3" audio_files
        fi
done
</code></pre>

<p>
Did it work? Please tell me it worked...
</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ ls -l audio_files/ | wc -l
    2305
</code></pre>

<p>
Off by one error? <b>NOOOOOOO</b>. JK it's fine, I'm not sure where that extra file is coming from but I guess it's no problem. Perhaps my calculations didn't factor in "empty" loops which just consist of silence.
</p>

<p>
Here's the loop we get by combining <code class="inline-code">k1&#95;156.mp3</code>, <code class="inline-code">s1&#95;37.mp3</code>, and <code class="inline-code">h1&#95;12345678.mp3</code>:
</p>

<p>
<audio style="display: block; filter: sepia(20%) saturate(70%) grayscale(1) contrast(99%) invert(12%); width: 200px; height: 25px;" controls><source src="images/output.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio>
</p>

<p>
Very satisfying! I can imagine using this technique to automate the creation of somewhat randomized music. Here's a <a href="images/permuting_sounds_demo.html">demo</a> of the drum sequencer page you can play with.
</p>

<p>
Hope this was cool! Warm regards.
</p>

<h3> Notes</h3>

<ul>
	<li>If you want to be able to combine multiple loops and have them be "in time" with one another, make sure all of your sounds have the same duration (or at least that the durations are in some sort of ratio with one another). For example, all of my drum sounds are like ~0.5 seconds long (idk I'm making that number up), and silence.mp3 is also of the same length.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Also, if you want to combine multiple loops in the command line to create new audio files, rather than just playing the loops at the same time with JavaScript, you might find this useful:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="sh">ffmpeg -i input0.mp3 -i input1.mp3 -filter_complex amix=inputs=2:duration=longest output.mp3
</code></pre>

<p>
(That comes via <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14498539/how-to-overlay-downmix-two-audio-files-using-ffmpeg">llogan on StackOverflow</a>)
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lastly, just to put it out there, all of the loops in total came out to be <code class="inline-code">91.8 MB</code> large, with each being ~<code class="inline-code">38 KB</code> large. Not so bad, honestly. Host the files on GitHub and serve them using GitHub Pages!</li>
</ul>

Richard Matthew Stallman
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>
	Unfortunately, as of today 2019-16-09, Richard Stallman has resigned as president of the Free Software Foundation. 
	I have to be honest, I don't agree with the outcome of this debacle. I am all for outing toxic people and removing them 
	from communities, when deserved, but I believe that this situation was based on a complete misunderstanding of Stallman 
	as a human being. As somebody who is exceptionally contrarian and pedantic, Stallman's behavior was completely characteristic
	of his typical self -- a true character, with good intentions but a persona which is definitely an acquired taste. I'm not
	attempting to glorify him. Understand, Stallman is not a normal person, he's not a millionaire business mogul, he's not 
	a professor using his authority to manipulate his students into sleeping with him, he's not a predator -- he's an 
	honest-to-god geek, hacker, nerd, creep straight out of a 70s/80s stereotype. On the political spectrum he's so far on
	the left that he may as well be off the grid -- I am sure he was mistaken as "another conservative male defending Epstein".
	On the Autism spectrum, he's likely present. A person with little to no social media exposure, no cell phone, ignorance to/of 
	social rules, and who is a boomer has many things going against them when expected to conform to rapidly changing social standards.
	<br><br>
	<i> > Did I even really know who Richard Stallman was before those emails? To be honest, not really</i> - author of the Medium 
	article calling to "Remove Richard Stallman".
	<br>
	<i> > "Iâ€™ve learned to understand how sex with a child can harm per psychologically [sic]." </i> - article on Stallman resigning
	<br><br>
	It is obvious that these people have no idea who Stallman is. If you've visited his website, you may have read about Stallman's
	proposed alternative to the gender-neutral pronoun "they" -- "per". Stallman is seen using that pronoun above, but the author
	of the article went ahead and presumed it was a typo. What else did they presume?
	<br><br>

	My world is shaken. To me, rms is as influential as Dennis Ritchie or Ken Thompson (terribly sorry to bring their names into this).
	How will computer science live without Richard Stallman? I'm sorry, but I won't be removing Stallman from my homepage.
	
	<br><br>
	Update: I liked <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/richard-stallman-and-the-fall-of-the-clueless-nerd/">this</a> article on the situation by Steven Levy.
	I felt like it struck a balance between pitchforks and "incels defending Stallman".
	Specifically, I appreciated this analysis:
	<br><br>
	<i>"If the question was 'When does obliviousness become inexcusable?' Selam Jie Gano had an answer. Now."</i>
	<br><br>
	I also liked Luke Smith's description of Stallman as someone who is ideologically consistent and proud of it.
	Stallman's ignorance to social standards are what allow him to actually live up to this description.

	<br><br>
	Update #2: I'm happy other people are interpreting this like I am, for
	a minute I was worried that I was going mad. I'm not one to ramble about
	political correctness and "cancel culture", those terms and thinking 
	about them (from both sides) makes me nauseous, but something about
	this has had me feeling terrible for the past few days.
	<br><br>
	I really loved <a href="https://jackbaruth.com/?p=16779">this post</a> about
	Stallman, besides the last section and wherever else the author goes
	full boomer mode. Actually I really disliked that part.
	<br><br>
	Another <a href="https://medium.com/@thomas.bushnell/a-reflection-on-the-departure-of-rms-18e6a835fd84">good post</a>. 
	The articles/posts I link differ in their thoughts. I am confused and don't know what to believe.
	A picture of the world is being painted for me constantly and I am no longer
	able to tell what conception is mine and what has been presented to me as true.
	
	<br><br>
	Update #3: <a href="https://sterling-archermedes.github.io/">This post</a> pulled the full quotes from Stallman which were misreported.
	I thought that I did my homework, but even I hadn't read some of these quotes in context before.
	
	<br><br>
	Update #4: <a>https://archive.is/emKyT#selection-57151.0-57151.25</a>
	<br>:( Come on, have some heart.

An invaluable lesson learned
</title><description><![CDATA[
<h4> git good before you dig yourself a hole you can't get out of </h4>

<p> I need to be more careful. In the past week I've messed up quite a few of
my things. This post is a quick reflection on what I've done, so I can 
remember to be more thorough in the future. 
</p>

<p> So, what have I done? </p>

<h4>#1</h4>
<p>
About a week back I got myself a "beater laptop" so I could freely experiment
with it and not worry about messing anything up. Well, it turns out that
you still need to have enough sense to not completely break Windows. My 
plan was to play around with FreeBSD, and have it dual-booted with the default
Windows 10 that came with the laptop. I kind of rushed through the installation,
so the end result was (1) failure to actually install FreeBSD on the HDD, and 
(2) deleting a crucial partition of the Windows OS which led to it not working anymore. 
I felt like I had nothing to lose, until I ended up with a laptop that wouldn't boot.
</p>

<p>
Bonus: At that point I decided to just go with ol' Ubuntu, even though I was trying very hard
to escape from it. As luck would have it, that didn't work out either and the laptop was still
unresponsive (but hey, at least I was forced to get a little familiar with the BIOS!). 
This actually wasn't my fault, my USB crapped out completely so it wasn't working at all.
Oh, and before resorting to Ubuntu I decided to try out Debian (if not FreeBSD, why not step
one level down to something a little less exotic but still new territory, eh?). Whilst trying to
create a live USB, mostly from memory and in a hurry, I most likely "borked" my main laptop (a
Mac, which I was trying very hard to preserve). "Borked" isn't my terminology -- that's what some
guy at school told me I did when I asked him for help lmfao. I was using command line utilities 
to partition my USB and make it live (specifically dd, which every online guide mentions with 
the same energy as a student at Hogwarts would mention Voldemort), but since I had done this before
I was not really proceeding with too much caution. What likely happened was that I somehow partitioned 
my actual HDD instead, which is definitely epic, proud of myself. Laptop still works as usual though --
it could've been worse.
</p>

<h4>#2</h4>
<p>This trip-up doesn't have reprocussions as costly as #1, but it appears that I was walking on a 
sentimental tightrope of whose existence I was not aware of for more than a year. You've likely heard
of external hard drives -- they're typically used to back up your files. In order to actually back those
files up, you'd typically use an application such as Time Machine or Carbon Copy Cloner (from now on, CCC).
I've used both, and had negative experiences with both. Chances are, that's my fault! This time around, I 
was using CCC. It's important to note that I'm a generally nostalgic person, so I really do not enjoy losing
memerobilia (whether physical or on the computer). I simply wanted to take all the files from my laptop, and
copy them over to my hard drive -- and that's what I thought I was doing every time I used CCC to back up 
my stuff. I realized, though, that by default CCC attempts to recreate my laptop's current filesystem 
on the external hard drive. This means that all old files which are no longer on my laptop -- but are 
on the external drive -- get moved to some special folder called something like "CCC Safety Net", while CCC
proceeds to make my drive look exactly like my laptop. Excuse me, but why are you deleting or moving anything on my
destination drive!? All I asked for was to take something from my laptop and copy it over.
Oh, it looks like that's actually an advanced option called "Don't delete anything".
Shouldn't that be the default setting? Anyways, this was my fault, as I didn't read closely enough. I am quite
upset now though, as the organization of my external drive is confusing at best. On the bright side, 
I think the files are all still there.
</p>

<h4>#3</h4>
<p>
This situation, which inspired this post, was a royal mess which definitely took a few months off my life. Of course
it had to do with git! This wasn't my first run-in with git -- I think I remember breaking a few repositories before,
but they never had anything very important or substantial in them. This time, I broke the repo which I was using to 
host my site. The amount of time I spent working on my website far surpasses the time I've spent on any other single
project. You can imagine the anguish you'd feel after potentially losing something you've put so much work into. 
Everyone always says, use version control to back up your code! That's all great until you actually corrupt your repository,
at which point Google will lead you to results with a completely different sentiment "don't use git as your sole backup tool".
But then again, that argument can be applied to anything. That's why the lesson I learned wasn't "don't trust git", but rather
something else which I will properly phrase at the end of this post.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, here's what happened. I have a page on my site with a music player, and I store the music files in a folder within 
my repository (I then link to their location on GitHub in order to play them). Originally, I decided to use the wav files
I already had on my computer, since I wanted to preserve sound quality. These files were huge though, like 20MB a piece. 
I've long replaced them with mp3 files, but my repository did not shrink in size. I realized that this is because the old files
were still stored in the .git folder (specifically in a "packfile" which I guess is all of the old files compressed into one).
So, I went on a quest to remove all of the wav files from existence, and hopefully rejuvinate my repository. Once again I trusted
StackOverflow, and once again I "borked" it all. What was supposed to remove any traces of the wav files instead corrupted
my repository. So, no head? What did I learn from all of this? Don't use git reset! Just kidding, what I actually learned
was to not be stubborn and use a GUI :). No, I'm still kidding, I would never say something like that. I just learned that 
I'm an idiot. Somewhere along the line I messed up, and I think the repository was beyond repair. I rescued the commit history 
from an old backup (thanks CCC for not deleting it), created a fresh repository, and started anew. Rest in peace to those
129 commits, though.
</p>

<h4>What did I learn?</h4>
<p>It's too easy to forget that everything is an abstraction. I feel like I understand my environment and the tools that 
I use, because I use them frequently enough to feel comfortable, but come on, I'm not a wizard yet and chances are neither are you.
When feces hit the fan, it's time to stop being lazy and be VERY meticulous about your every move. From now on I will try my best
to read documentation, and test things before I set them in stone (even the complex situations which will be very annoying to replicate). 
I will learn to not "bork", because I am not a doge. By the way, that guy never ended up helping very much (refer to #1 to find the
original creator of the term "borked", which is who I'm referring to). I learned that I will never accept this reality: I cannot
live my life forever programming by poking, eventually I NEED to understand how the things below me work. This is a general reflection now, I guess,
cause whatever I just said barely applies to the above 3 scenarios. In regard to git specifically, I learned that git revert is quite nice in a pinch,
and that I should read "Git Internals - Plumbing and Porcelain". You should probably read it too.

Hello, World!
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p> Well, here we are. After a few weeks of procrastination I've finally gotten to setting up a blog. A tiny slice of the internet just for me! </p>
<p> I'm hoping to use this as a means of reflecting on things -- I've been so busy lately that I've almost forgotten how to think. </p>

<br>
<img src="images/flowers.jpeg" style = "width: 25%; height: 25%">
<p><i>Some nice flowers, for testing and aromatic purposes :-)</i></p>
<br>
<p> That's all from me for today! Good night internet. </p>

<h2>Cappuccinos</h2>
<p class="subtitle">November 2nd, 2023 — Josh</p>

<img src="img/fallen_angels.jpg" alt="Still from Fallen Angels by Wong Kar-wai">

<p> A few months back, I gave a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYMPEhUBDyM">talk</a> at a &#42;BSD User
Group meetup which I titled <i>"Down With the Corporate Ethos, Up With the
Sunrise: Inspiring a New Generation of Hackers"</i>. In the talk I tried to
paint a monster and advocate for its replacement -- the beaurocratic, vain,
bloated, entitled, greedy, corporate, pointless, delusional, tired,
frustrating, bumbling mass that is the computing industry, and how devoid it is
of life. Life is not like that. In life we have sunrises, autumn leaves, a
stream with bright fish, and rosy cheeks. This essential romanticism is missing
completely from our practice as computer scientists and programmers. [1] </p>

<p>The below quote has always resonated with me:</p>

<blockquote>If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood,
divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and
endless sea.</blockquote>

<p>As time passes I come to understand and value this notion more. My love of
seasons; the idea that there are some things which can not be communicated
directly, they must be evoked or danced around if you want to communicate the
full richness; poetry; myths; the idea of revelation, something completely
separate from the realm of reason; <!--"If you make things that aren't obvious,
you can make things that can actually become larger, by people's
interpretations"; -->paintings; smells; that one memory that keeps your heart
beating.</p>

<p>I was completely steeping myself in this way of thinking in the weeks
before I gave the talk, exactly how I used to steep myself in piles of study
material before exams at school. In school I was scared that I would let go and
forget everything, so I kept studying. Before the talk I was scared that I
would become depressed, it's cyclical.</p>

<p> But this brings me to cappuccinos, somehow the harbringer of this way of
thinking for me.</p>

<p> A few years ago I watched the movie "Chungking Express" by Wong Kar-wai at
night in the middle of Greenwich Village, after which me and my girlfriend
stumbled upon a place called Caffè Reggio. We reflected on the movie, and I had
a cappuccino with a chocolate croissant. I don't know why this was such a
profound moment for me, but I felt really alive.</p>

<p> Not too longer after that I came across the painting "Nighthawks" by Edward
Hopper, and I was ecstatic. That's literally me, I am the nighthawk, this is so
real! I kept bringing it up to all of my friends for the next few weeks because
I was happy to have finally resonated with a painting, but it turns out that
this is a very popular painting that everyone already knew about so I couldn't
get across the synchronicity that I'd experienced lol.</p>

<p> I've mostly gotten over my random fetish for cappuccinos now (I will just
take a coffee [2]), but it remains a symbol for me, and I've learned to
appreciate the power of a pleasant memory. That's what keeps life moving
forward, your heart beating.</p>

<p> And so, I wanted to dedicate the rest of this post to three cappuccinos I
love.</p>

<h2>Caffè Reggio</h2>

<p>Allegedly home to America's first cappuccino. Apparently Allen Ginsberg and
Jack Kerouac used to hang out here.</p>

<img src="img/caffe_reggio1.jpg" alt="caffe reggio outside" style="width:70%">

<p>They also have a bench that belonged to the Medici family in Italy... you
can sit on it and have your coffee.</p>

<img src="img/caffe_reggio2.jpg" alt="caffe reggio inside" style="width:70%">

<p>Their cappuccino is delicious :), and I always get a Nutella croissant</p>

<img src="img/cappuccino1.jpg" alt="caffe reggio cappuccino">

<p>IFC center nearby often screens older movies (actually good ones, not Pet
Sematary).</p>

<h2>Safir Bakery</h2>

<p>This is a nice little Turkish bakery with really delicious baklava. I do not
want to eat baklava ever again though after the amount I ate here lol. One day
I was fortunate enough to try a cappuccino from them, and I was really
surprised at how good it tastes.</p>

<img src="img/cappuccino2.jpg" alt="safir bakery cappuccino">"

<p>When I visited Italy for the first time recently, I had a cappuccino at a
cafe (or as they say...bar) in Florence and it tasted virtually identical to
the one I had back home at this bakery, which really caught me off guard. I
think that is a huge compliment to the bakery haha.</p>

	<figcaption>Florence has a number of bridges running in parallel to one another
	over a canal, it is really beautiful, and I really miss those bridges. I got my
	cappuccino right at the foot of Ponte Vecchio (pictured here)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is the cappuccino which I like with NO SUAGR (well, usually I ask for
"just a little"). It just tastes really good as is; I somehow find myself even
getting a little upset when it turns out being noticeably sweet.</p>

<h2>Prince Tea House</h2>

<p>This is a bit of a random pick for me. I think Prince Tea House is
technically a chain, and their dessert is pretty mehhhh, and yet I still really
like their cappuccino, enough to include it here.</p>

<img src="img/cappuccino3.jpg" alt="prince tea house cappuccino">

<p>It doesn't usually look like this lol this is just a cool photo of theirs I
found online, but it's one of those "latte art" coffee drinks, rather than just
the old school foamed milk on top. It's cloyingly sweet, and it's damn
delicious.</p>

</figure>

<p>Most importantly, I always get it with french fries........</p>

<h2>The most romantic drink of all</h2>

<p>I would be remiss if I didn't mention the mythical Soccer Tavern, where my
friend Brigid's dad works. I love that place. Having a Guinness there holds the
very same mystical property for me.</p>

<h2>Fuck it, glamor reel</h2>

<p>If you ever visit one of these places, I'd be super happy if you emailed me
a let me know how it went haha. I don't think these are objectively the best
cappuccinos or anything like that, they are just places where I made memories,
and that's why I like them. If you want to go together and hang out let me
know, maybe that could be fun...!</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p> [1] I really care about this, I refuse to resign to being an automaton
until I'm off the clock. Laboring is in our nature and an essential part of our
being, and there is so much left to fix in our planet and our societies. Why
are we all wasting our time? Why are we so unhappy? I am still entranced by the
nature of computing and the nascent field of programming, yet somehow we have
made using a computer the antithesis of living -- hunched indoors alone with
pained eyeballs screaming into the hatebox. Although I feel stupid saying it, I
was excited by Apple's Vision Pro, finally computing in the deep woods.  </p>

<p> [2] Not to say that I've given up my nature as a nighthawk, nothing beats a
cup of coffee at night in the right circumstances </p>

	Unfortunately, as of today 2019-16-09, Richard Stallman has resigned as president of the Free Software Foundation. 
	I have to be honest, I don't agree with the outcome of this debacle. I am all for outing toxic people and removing them 
	from communities, when deserved, but I believe that this situation was based on a complete misunderstanding of Stallman 
	as a human being. As somebody who is exceptionally contrarian and pedantic, Stallman's behavior was completely characteristic
	of his typical self -- a true character, with good intentions but a persona which is definitely an acquired taste. I'm not
	attempting to glorify him. Understand, Stallman is not a normal person, he's not a millionaire business mogul, he's not 
	a professor using his authority to manipulate his students into sleeping with him, he's not a predator -- he's an 
	honest-to-god geek, hacker, nerd, creep straight out of a 70s/80s stereotype. On the political spectrum he's so far on
	the left that he may as well be off the grid -- I am sure he was mistaken as "another conservative male defending Epstein".
	On the Autism spectrum, he's likely present. A person with little to no social media exposure, no cell phone, ignorance to/of 
	social rules, and who is a boomer has many things going against them when expected to conform to rapidly changing social standards.
	<br><br>
	<i> > Did I even really know who Richard Stallman was before those emails? To be honest, not really</i> - author of the Medium 
	article calling to "Remove Richard Stallman".
	<br>
	<i> > "Iâ€™ve learned to understand how sex with a child can harm per psychologically [sic]." </i> - article on Stallman resigning
	<br><br>
	It is obvious that these people have no idea who Stallman is. If you've visited his website, you may have read about Stallman's
	proposed alternative to the gender-neutral pronoun "they" -- "per". Stallman is seen using that pronoun above, but the author
	of the article went ahead and presumed it was a typo. What else did they presume?
	<br><br>

	My world is shaken. To me, rms is as influential as Dennis Ritchie or Ken Thompson (terribly sorry to bring their names into this).
	How will computer science live without Richard Stallman? I'm sorry, but I won't be removing Stallman from my homepage.
	
	<br><br>
	Update: I liked <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/richard-stallman-and-the-fall-of-the-clueless-nerd/">this</a> article on the situation by Steven Levy.
	I felt like it struck a balance between pitchforks and "incels defending Stallman".
	Specifically, I appreciated this analysis:
	<br><br>
	<i>"If the question was 'When does obliviousness become inexcusable?' Selam Jie Gano had an answer. Now."</i>
	<br><br>
	I also liked Luke Smith's description of Stallman as someone who is ideologically consistent and proud of it.
	Stallman's ignorance to social standards are what allow him to actually live up to this description.
	<br><br>
	I really loved <a href="https://jackbaruth.com/?p=16779">this post</a> about
	Stallman, besides the last section and wherever else the author goes
	full boomer mode. Actually I really disliked that part.
	<br><br>
	Another <a href="https://medium.com/@thomas.bushnell/a-reflection-on-the-departure-of-rms-18e6a835fd84">good post</a>. 
	<br><br>
	Update #3: <a href="https://sterling-archermedes.github.io/">This post</a> pulled the full quotes from Stallman which were misreported.
	I thought that I did my homework, but even I hadn't read some of these quotes in context before.
	
	<br><br>
	Update #4: <a>https://archive.is/emKyT#selection-57151.0-57151.25</a>
	<br>:( Come on, have some heart.

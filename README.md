**Currently, the site consists of six pages:**
* My [link-hoarding cupboard.](https://josh8.com/home) **[Perpetually IN PROGRESS]**

* A [page for my music](https://josh8.com/tunes)

* A [blog](https://josh8.com/blog)  :)

* A [search tool](https://josh8.com/college-langs) for what programming languages universities use to teach their introductory programming classes **[IN PROGRESS]**
    * There are many programming languages which CS deparments may choose to teach their introductory courses in, yet most students have either had no previous experience programming, or have taken AP Computer Science A which is taught solely using Java. It can't hurt to start preparing early!
    
* A page containing various [papers](https://josh8.com/papers) I've written:
   * Artificial Intelligence and Ethics: A Compromise 
   * Privacy in the Age of Computers: Encryption, Steganography, Cryptography, and more.
   * Concert Report: A Trip Elsewhere (Rooftop)
   * Illmatic – Hip Hop's Magnum Opus
   * Self Reflection on Writing 
   
* A [sitemap](https://josh8.com/sitemap) (necessary to remedy by unintuitive landing page :P)


**In the works:**
* A page where you can talk to Dog himself. Dog is very wise, and he will give you The Wisdom you seek. (He's also animated and probably doesn't work on Internet Explorer).

* Something regarding plants and elephants ♥

**Note:**
* In a blaze of glory, I attempted to clean the original <i>josh8</i> repository of all the junk files it had accumulated over time. StackOverflow proved to be a very dangerous resource, and I ended up messing some things up. So, I started fresh (I only moved the necessary files). I'm relatively sure all went well, but I can't shake the feeling that I've left something behind :(
* Oringinal Repo: 129 Commits

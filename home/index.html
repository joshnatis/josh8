                    Welcome to my humble abode. I've become something of an online trashman over the past few years -- I often stumble upon information that I don't want to lose, so I organize it here for my convenience (and maybe yours too, dig around maybe you'll find something cool). This is also a place to commemorate people who I admire. I like to humanize the gurus and legendary personas that I read and hear about. I find that birthdays help with this -- did you know that Ken Thompson and I almost share a birthday!? Have a good stay.

                <h2 id = "the_history">The history and people of computing </h2>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Much like everything else in life, computer science didn't appear out of thin air. I seldom come across anyone interested in the culture and history of computing and its subgroups, which is sad and kind of strange. The public view of CS seems to paint it as an ultra-practical skillset and a pathway to economic success. Perhaps this is a symptom of the divide between STEM and the humanities, or the inevitable side effect of Late Capitalism. Either way, to the layman, this rich history is virtually unknown, and computer science seems to be boiled down to the technical sum of its parts.
                    <br><br><br>
                    
                    With that in mind, here's a list of people worth knowing (in no particular order):
                </p>
                <p id="ppl">
                    Richard Stallman (rms), Eric S. Raymond (esr), Linus Torvalds, Jon Hall (maddog), Dennis M. Ritchie (dmr), Ken L. Thompson (ken), Brian W. Kernighan (bwk), Donald Knuth (dek), John Von Neumann, John G. Kemeny, Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, Tim Berners-Lee, Doug Engelbart, Edsger Dijkstra, John McCarthy, Aaron Swartz, Terry Davis, Joe Armstrong, Francesco Vianello, Richard Feynman, Leonard Susskind, Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Leonhard Euler, George Boole, Paul Erdös, Vint Cerf
                </p>
                <script>

                        let g = Math.floor((Math.random() * 255));
                        let b = Math.floor((Math.random() * 255));
                        return "rgb(" + r + "," + g + "," + b + ");"
                    }

                    let ppl = document.getElementById("ppl");
                    let str = "";
                    ppl.innerHTML.split(",").forEach(name =>
                        str += "<span style=\"white-space: nowrap; color: "
                            + color() + "\">" + name + "</span>, ");
                    ppl.innerHTML = str.slice(0, -2);

The knights jump, the kings orbit, the sun goes down, and every move is the truth. It's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but it's in Estonian. </p>
                    <p> Today science is biased towards rejecting any theory involving God. It is called naturalism. It proposes that any and all observable phenomena must have a natural cause. It also has the side-effect of barring God from having any influence in the world. If it appears that God has an influence in the world, a different explanation must be found. And men are masters of creating alternative explanations. It is called skepticism.</p>
                    <p>Education is an extension of the human instinct to reproduce. One of the things we should be doing is to purposely invent better ways to think, and then figure out how to teach them to children to create much more able adults than we are.</p>

                    <p>In the 80s and 90s, engineers built complex systems by combining simple and well-understood parts. The goal of SICP was to provide the abstraction language for reasoning about such systems. Today, this is no longer the case. Engineers now routinely write code for complicated hardware that they don’t fully understand (and often can’t understand because of trade secrecy.) The same is true at the software level, since programming environments consist of gigantic libraries with enormous functionality. Programming today is “More like science. You grab this piece of library and you poke at it. You write programs that poke it and see what it does. And you say, ‘Can I tweak it to do the thing I want?'”. The “analysis-by-synthesis” view of SICP — where you build a larger system out of smaller, simple parts — became irrelevant. Nowadays, we do programming by poking.</p>
                    <p>I have no idea if other fields have this same problem — my guess is that physicists are particularly prone to it, since we are trained early on to think that physicists are simply smarter than chemists or biologists. Those other fields are for the hard workers. We don’t put mathemeticians on this scale, because we secretly believe they’re smarter than us. Note to the biologist lynch mob: tounge is in cheek.)</p>

                    <p>one should base one’s work satisfaction on realistic achievements, such as advancing the state of knowledge in one’s specialty, improving one’s understanding of a field, or communicating this understanding successfully to others, rather than basing it on exceptionally rare events, such as spectacularly solving a major open problem, or achieving major recognition from one’s peers.</p>

                    <p>What you do need is some amount of time spent on the idea that computer programs are mathematical objects which can be reasoned about mathematically. This is the part that the vast majority of people are missing nowadays, and it can be a little tricky to wrap your brain around at first.</p>

                    <p>C is a Spartan language, and so should your naming be. Unlike Modula-2 and Pascal programmers, C programmers do not use cute names like ThisVariableIsATemporaryCounter. A C programmer would call that variable tmp, which is much easier to write, and not the least more difficult to understand.</p>

                    <p>I find it bizarre that people use the term "coding" to mean programming. For decades, we used the word "coding" for the work of low-level staff in a business programming team. The designer would write a detailed flow chart, then the "coders" would write code to implement the flow chart. This is quite different from what we did and do in the hacker community -- with us, one person designs the program and writes its code as a single activity. When I developed GNU programs, that was programming, but it was definitely not coding. Since I don't think the recent fad for "coding" is an improvement, I have decided not to adopt it. I don't use the term "coding", except if I were talking about a business programming team which has coders.</p>

                    <p>People often miss this, or even deny it, but there are many examples of object-oriented programming in the kernel.

                    <p><i>Thompson</i>: One day I got this idea -- pipes, essentially exactly as they are today. I put them in the operating system in an hour -- they're trivial, they really are super trivial when you've got redirecting IO like UNIX already had. 
                    
					The idea was just mind blowing to us. Dennis and I came in and rewrote everything in the world -- our world, in one night. We converted everything. Mostly what we did was throw out extraneous messages. Like, sort would never say "hey I'm sorting, I'm merging, I'm doing this, I'm working on this file". All that garbage is gone -- sort would read, sort, then write. And suddenly sort was what we'd call a "filter" in that day. Then we converted everything that processed something into filters. It was massive, and just exciting.

					<p><i>Thompson</i>: I've always been interested in chess, I played it when I was in 7th grade because that's when Bobby Fischer was right at his height. Bobby Fischer and I are like 10 years apart in age, except that he's dead. So, I would come home and on the cover of Life Magazine there'd be "Bobby Fischer". And here I am, exactly the same age, and what do I do? So I felt very very, I don't know, worthless. I joined the chess club and played chess in school, and was good at it, but I didn't like it. I didn't like to win -- because you feel sorry for somebody who'd take it seriously, and I didn't like to lose of course. And that cut down on my options.</p>

                    <p>The majority of ordinary people want to live a peaceful life. In fact, the people who are the most determined to live a peaceful and calm life are constantly running into capitalism as an insurmountable obstacle to living it. Every single day we're pushed aside, pushed at the job, we're put under all kinds of pressure in the family and society -- anywhere we go in capitalist society, which impedes on our very modest wish to live a perfectly ordinary, non-eventful and harmonious life. Because of the pressures the crisis of capitalism puts on these people, you see that the people who are most determined to live a normal and tranquil life are pushed towards drawing more and more radical and revolutionary ideas, contrary to their wishes. And that in fact is the driving force of all revolutions.</p>

                    <p>What Are You Afraid Of? Another way of looking at it is that you’re picking a license based on what you are afraid of. All of these licenses assume you’re afraid of being sued. The MIT license is if you’re afraid no one will use your code; you’re making the licensing as short and non-intimidating as possible. The Apache License you are somewhat afraid of no one using your code, but you are also afraid of legal ambiguity and patent trolls. With the GPL licenses, you are afraid of someone else profiting from your work (and ambiguity, and patent trolls). This is a radical simplification, but if nothing else it can be a helpful framework in discussing with your attorney what license makes sense for your software.</p>

                    <p>The hacker ethic that played such a large part in advancing computer science, building gcc, building Linux, indeed building the world's computer systems and engineering the biggest peaceful economic boom in history, is more than just a thirst for knowledge about computers. It's the obsessive belief that knowledge exists to be shared, that helping someone by making their computer run better (or their air conditioner) is one of life's joys, and that the rules that prevent sharing and helping exist to be broken. [...] The hero is the one who knows how to fix things, and fixes them -- despite not being "authorized." The evil is the paperwork we construct around ourselves, the forms and regulations that take the place of people freely helping each other.</p>
                    <p>Next time your boss comes to you and asks "Can't you just...?" Stop. Think about what he just asked. Your boss is managing complexity and he doesn't even know it, and he's just described the interface he wants. Before you dismiss him as asking for the impossible, at least consider whether or not you could arrange things so that it looks like you're doing the really simple thing he's asking for, rather than making it obvious to all your users that you're doing the really complex thing that you have to do to achieve what he asked for. You know that's what you're doing, but you don't have to share your pain with people who don't know or care about the underlying complexity.</p>
                    <p>The fact is, your brain is built to do Perl programming. You have a deep desire to turn the complex into the simple, and Perl is just another tool to help you do that--just as I am using English right now to try to simplify reality. I can use English for that because English is a mess. This is important, and a little hard to understand. English is useful because it's a mess. Since English is a mess, it maps well onto the problem space, which is also a mess, which we call reality. Similarly, Perl was designed to be a mess (though in the nicest of possible ways).</p>

                    <p>Finally, although the subject is not a pleasant one, I must mention PL/1, a programming language for which the defining documentation is of a frightening size and complexity.

I absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the programming language —our basic tool, mind you!— already escapes our intellectual control.</p>
                    <p>Argument three is based on the constructive approach to the problem of program correctness. Today a usual technique is to make a program and then to test it. But: program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence. The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness. But one should not first make the program and then prove its correctness, because then the requirement of providing the proof would only increase the poor programmer’s burden. On the contrary: the programmer should let correctness proof and program grow hand in hand. Argument three is essentially based on the following observation. If one first asks oneself what the structure of a convincing proof would be and, having found this, then constructs a program satisfying this proof’s requirements, then these correctness concerns turn out to be a very effective heuristic guidance. By definition this approach is only applicable when we restrict ourselves to intellectually manageable programs, but it provides us with effective means for finding a satisfactory one among these.</p>
                    <p>We all know that the only mental tool by means of which a very finite piece of reasoning can cover a myriad cases is called “abstraction”; as a result the effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a competent programmer. In this connection it might be worth-while to point out that the purpose of abstracting is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.</p>
                    <p>The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.</p>

                    <p>Open Source Won the Battle, But Lost the War... a larger share of computing is performed by fixed function products, where the ability to modify the product is not part of the value proposition for the customer. Now ironically, open source has flourished in these fixed function devices, but more often than not, the benefits of those freedoms being realized more by those making the products rather than end users (which actually was true of the software market even back then: Microsoft was a big consumer of open source software, but their customers were not). Similarly, one could argue that open source has struggled more in the general purpose desktop space than anywhere else, but as the web and cloud computing has grown, desktop computing has increasingly been used for a narrower purpose (primarily running a browser), with the remaining functions running in the cloud (ironically, primarily on open source platforms). In short: open source does really own the general purpose computing space, but the market has become more sophisticated.

                    <p>Meanwhile, the GPL has legally enforced a consortia on major commercial companies. Red Hat, Novell, IBM, and many others are all contributing, and feel safe in doing so because the others are legally required to do the same. It's basically created a "safe" zone of cooperation, without anyone having to sign complicated legal documents. A company can't feel safe contributing code to the BSDs, because its competitors might simply copy it without reciprocating. There's much more corporate cooperation in the GPL'ed kernel code than with the BSD'd kernel code. Which means that in practice, it's actually been the GPL that's most "business-friendly". So while the BSDs have lost energy every time a company gets involved, the GPL'ed programs gain almost every time a company gets involved. And that explains it all.</p>

                    <p>The construction of software should be an engineering discipline. However, this doesn’t preclude individual craftsmanship. Think about the large cathedrals built in Europe during the Middle Ages. Each took thousands of person-years of effort, spread over many decades. Lessons learned were passed down to the next set of builders, who advanced the state of structural engineering with their accomplishments. But the carpenters, stonecutters, carvers, and glass workers were all craftspeople, interpreting the engineering requirements to produce a whole that transcended the purely mechanical side of the construction. It was their belief in their individual contributions that sustained the projects: We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals. (Quarry worker’s creed).</p>

                    makes you wonder, that you don't know the answer to, and in getting to the answer brings you to an understanding of the bigger world around us

                    <p>Consider also this; all the time you spend studying is time you don't spend helping others, or keeping fit, or being a good friend.

                    As for overspecialisation, people underestimate the importance of intersectionality. You cannot understand physics without a strong grasp of maths. You cannot understand literature without being aware of the historical context in which it was written. Study multiple areas to understand your own better would be my view, as it gives you that all-important tool: context.</p>

                    <p>Years ago, anthropologist Margaret Mead was asked by a student what she considered to be the first sign of civilization in a culture. The student expected Mead to talk about fishhooks or clay pots or grinding stones. But no. Mead said that the first sign of civilization in an ancient culture was a femur (thighbone) that had been broken and then healed. Mead explained that in the animal kingdom, if you break your leg, you die. You cannot run from danger, get to the river for a drink or hunt for food. You are meat for prowling beasts. No animal survives a broken leg long enough for the bone to heal. A broken femur that has healed is evidence that someone has taken time to stay with the one who fell, has bound up the wound, has carried the person to safety and has tended the person through recovery. Helping someone else through difficulty is where civilization starts, Mead said." We are at our best when we serve others. Be civilized.</p>

                    <p>Dogfood. It is good practice to use the software one is developing on a daily basis, even when one is not actively working on developing or testing the product. This is known as "eating one's dogfood". Many bugs, usually user interface (UI) issues but also occasionally web standards bugs, are found by people using daily builds of the product while not actively looking for failures. A bug found using this technique which prevents the user of the product on a regular basis is called a "dogfood" bug and is usually given a very high priority.</p>
                    <p>The code base's age makes it likely that its authors by now either have advanced to management positions where reading books as this one is frowned upon or have an eyesight unable to deal with this book's fonts.

                    <p>Read broadly (there are a few books recommended in my earlier columns). Always take jobs that expand what you might do (I rarely take a job in the same industry twice).  Have your own projects that you're interested in, and they don't need to be as large as a FreeBSD.  Code for fun and not always for profit if you can afford it.  I started by "playing with computers" as it was called when I was young and I continue to "play" as well as work.  Undirected learning has a place.</p>
                    <p>Multics Emacs proved to be a great success — programming new editing commands was so convenient that even the secretaries in his office started learning how to use it. They used a manual someone had written which showed how to extend Emacs, but didn't say it was a programming. So the secretaries, who believed they couldn't do programming, weren't scared off. They read the manual, discovered they could do useful things and they learned to program. So Bernie saw that an application — a program that does something useful for you — which has Lisp inside it and which you could extend by rewriting the Lisp programs, is actually a very good way for people to learn programming. It gives them a chance to write small programs that are useful for them, which in most arenas you can't possibly do. They can get encouragement for their own practical use — at the stage where it's the hardest — where they don't believe they can program, until they get to the point where they are programmers.</p>

                    <p>Finally there came in the mail an invitation from the Institute for Advanced Study: Einstein…von Neumann…Wyl…all these great minds! They write to me, and invite me to be a professor there! And not just a regular professor. Somehow they knew my feelings about the Institute: how it’s too theoretical; how there’s not enough real activity and challenge. So they write, “We appreciate that you have a considerable interest in experiments and in teaching, so we have made arrangements to create a special type of professorship, if you wish: half professor at Princeton University, and half at the Institute.”<br>Institute for Advanced Study! Special exception! A position better than Einstein, even! It was ideal; it was perfect; it was absurd!<br>It was absurd. The other offers had made me feel worse, up to a point.

I laughed at it while I was shaving, thinking about it.<br>And then I thought to myself, “You know, what they think of you is so fantastic, it’s impossible to live up to it.

I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It’s their mistake, not my failing.<br>It wasn’t a failure on my part that the Institute for Advanced Study expected me to be that good; it was impossible. It was clearly a mistake—and the moment I appreciated the possibility that they might be wrong, I realized that it was also true of all the other places, including my own university. I am what I am, and if they expected me to be good and they’re offering me some money for it, it’s their hard luck.</p>

                    <p>One thing to keep in mind when looking at GNU programs is that they're often intentionally written in an odd style to remove all questions of Unix copyright infringement at the time that they were written. The long-standing advice when writing GNU utilities used to be that if the program you were replacing was optimized for minimizing CPU use, write yours to minimize memory use, or vice-versa. Or in this case, if the program was optimized for simplicity, optimize for throughput.</p>

					<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I wish it was as easy for others to have such satisfaction these days.<br>
					&gt;&gt;Amen to that.  I think we all lived, you Bell Labs people especially, in a simpler time.  We were trying to fit into 64K, split I/D 128K, my Z80 was 64K but some extra for graphics, then the VAX came and we were trying for 1MB, Suns with 4MB.
					So small mattered a lot and that meant the Unix philosophy of do one thing and do it well worked quite nicely.
					What that also meant, to people coming on a little bit after, was that it was relatively easy to modify stuff, the stuff was not that complex. Even I had an easy time, my prime was back at Sun when SunOS was a uniprocessor OS.  That is dramatically simpler than a fully threaded SMP OS that has support for TCP offloading, NUMA, etc, etc. I really don't know how systems people do it these days, it is a much more complex world. So I'm with Norm, it was fun back in the day to be able to come in and have a big impact.  I too wish that it was as easy for young people to come in and have that impact.  I've done that and it was awesome, these days, I have no idea how I'd make a difference.<br>
					&gt;By doing something besides systems. There are tons of open source projects at the user level that make a difference. Consider something like AsciiDoc.  Less than 10 years old (methinks), and in use for production by at least one major technical publisher that I know of. (And it sure beats the pants off of DocBook XML.) Or the work I do on gawk, Chet on Bash, other GNU bits. There's a whole world out there besides just the kernel.</p>
					<p>Rules, guidelines, and principles are gems of distilled experience that should be studied and respected. But they’re never a substute for thinking critically about your work.</p>
					<p>The other way, which is actually a really meaningful thing to me, and it’s super super subtle, is that I included a fast-forward button, so you can fast forward the music, you can skip to the next track, et cetera. But the subtle part is that, when you press the fast-forward button, you have changed the playback speed of the piece of music, but the random-number generator is moving ahead at the same rate. And so, the result of that is that you’ve now offset the music a little bit from the random sequence that it would have gotten had you not pressed that button. And, so you are suddenly getting an entirely new version of the piece. It sounds pretty much identical, because I use randomness in this textural level in the sound synthesis. It’s not like it has any control at the actual musical level. But the philosophical side of it is that if you never press the fast-forward button, then it’s this closed computational system, and it’s basically output-only. You know, you’re turning on the chip, the code starts running and it’s this closed system that mirrors some basic number theory. And the moment you press the button, then you’ve kind of interjected in this pure closed system, and you’ve brought in all of the messiness of the real world — like whether or not our time and space is grid-based on the lowest level, or whether or not we have free will, or where randomness comes in in quantum mechanics. All of these messy real world things suddenly come into the system and it’s no longer this clean abstract thing. And so, for me, what that also means is that the work of mathematicians, like Alan Turing and Kurt Gödel, these people who really explored the limits of computation, and the limits of mathematics, really — their work in applicable until you press the fast-forward button. It’s applicable so long as this is a deterministic system, and you kind of kill that determinism when you press the fast-forward button. So I think of that as, like, playing the piece.</p>

I feel lightning bolts jump from my fingers when I squeeze the key to send my own thoughts back the other way.<br>Sometimes I'll hear the crisp clean signal of an A-1 operator, probably a retired operator, probably living in Phoenix and having trouble sleeping.

                    <p>What's interesting is that at the same time that we were doing AWK, there was a project at Xerox PARC called ... Poplar ... which had fairly similar goals. That is, they were going to take these files consisting of a lot of characters and you break them apart in various ways and you process them using some language and you pass them on. And they put a lot of work into clever ideas. It was a functional programming language. Which was ... especially then a big deal, now it's less of a big deal. And it was supposed to be user friendly ... They had all sorts of stuff. And AWK lived and Poplar died. And I don't know, you know, this has affected my view about people who talk about user interfaces fairly severely. I'm no longer convinced anybody knows anything about user interface. It's clear some things are easier to use and some things are harder to use. That's okay. But it's also clear that people, people learn a lot. ... although AWK s language is both C-like and not real elegant, a lot of AWK programming isn't done by getting the reference manual and writing code. What is done is by finding some AWK program that's very similar to what you want to do and changing it, okay? And then the fact that it's a little weird isn't so bad. It's, you know what you're just changing. AWK lives partly, I think, because of its programming by example.</p>

I don't know what he thinks he's doing, but that's certainly what it seemed to be like he was doing. And you have to know a lot to understand a one line answer to these things. And after a while the answers become extremely informative. But it really took a long time before I just understood anything Ken was saying.</p>

                    <p>I think almost every experienced programmer has gone through three stages and some go through four:<br>
					Cowboy coders or nuggets know little to nothing about design and view it as an unnecessary formality. If working on small projects for non-technical stakeholders, this attitude may serve them well for a while; it Gets Things Done, it impresses the boss, makes the programmer feel good about himself and confirms the idea that he knows what he's doing (even though he doesn't).<br>
					Architecture Astronauts have witnessed the failures of their first ball-of-yarn projects to adapt to changing circumstances. Everything must be rewritten and to prevent the need for another rewrite in the future, they create inner platforms, and end up spending 4 hours a day on support because nobody else understands how to use them properly.
					Quasi-engineers often mistake themselves for actual, trained engineers because they are genuinely competent and understand some engineering principles. They're aware of the underlying engineering and business concepts: Risk, ROI, UX, performance, maintainability, and so on. These people see design and documentation as a continuum and are usually able to adapt the level of architecture/design to the project requirements.<br>
					At this point, many fall in love with methodologies, whether they be Agile, Waterfall, RUP, etc. They start believing in the absolute infallibility and even necessity of these methodologies without realizing that in the actual software engineering field, they're merely tools, not religions. And unfortunately, it prevents them from ever getting to the final stage, which is:<br>
					Duct tape programmers AKA gurus or highly-paid consultants know what architecture and design they're going to use within five minutes after hearing the project requirements. All of the architecture and design work is still happening, but it's on an intuitive level and happening so fast that an untrained observer would mistake it for cowboy coding - and many do.<br>
					Generally these people are all about creating a product that's "good enough" and so their works may be a little under-engineered but they are miles away from the spaghetti code produced by cowboy coders. Nuggets cannot even identify these people when they're told about them, because to them, everything that is happening in the background just doesn't exist.<br>
					Some of you will probably be thinking to yourselves at this point that I haven't answered the question. That's because the question itself is flawed. Cowboy coding isn't a choice, it's a skill level, and you can't choose to be a cowboy coder any more than you can choose to be illiterate.<br>
					If you are a cowboy coder, then you know no other way.<br>
					If you've become an architecture astronaut, you are physically and psychologically incapable of producing software with no design.<br>
					If you are a quasi-engineer (or a professional engineer), then completing a project with little or no up-front design effort is a conscious choice (usually due to absurd deadlines) that has to be weighed against the obvious risks, and undertaken only after the stakeholders have agreed to them (usually in writing).<br>
					And if you are a duct-tape programmer, then there is never any reason to "cowboy code" because you can build a quality product just as quickly.</p>
					<p>One thing you have to be careful about, though, is that duct tape programmers are the software world equivalent of pretty boys… those breathtakingly good-looking young men who can roll out of bed, without shaving, without combing their hair, and without brushing their teeth, and get on the subway in yesterday’s dirty clothes and look beautiful, because that’s who they are. You, my friend, cannot go out in public without combing your hair. It will frighten the children. Because you’re just not that pretty.</p>
					<p>Hackers don't write documentation, or plan out their programming, instead they write Manifestos.</p>
                    <p>"Hypergrunge" was more specific, because a lot of the peripheral ideas about this record are like very directly dealing with observations in the music industry, and grunge is like, an insane thing, because it's a fallacy, it's totally fabricated. All grunge is hypergrunge. It's been synthesized by all of these marketing factors. You know about grunge speak? Or the story of grunge speak? There was a secretary at the Sub Pop office in the '90s, she was always getting interviewed because journalists would just come in and be like "So, what's grunge?" And she got sick of it, and she started tricking them or lying to them, like "Yeah, there's a whole language to grunge, dude." And she made up all these words that were like, grunge speak. [The New York Times] went and published this thing that she tricked them with, and I was so inspired by that.</p>

                    <p>Ever since the 50's, the fashion in language design has been minimalism. Languages were designed around paradigms, and paradigms were judged on elegance. If your choice of paradigm was lists, the result was LISP. If you decided on strings, you invented SNOBOL. Arrays, you wound up with APL. If your reasoning led you to logic, you ended up with Prolog. If you thought that descriptions of algorithms must be the basis of programming, then your fate was Algol. If assembly language stayed at the core of your world view, what you created would be an imperative lanugage and might look like any of C, BASIC or FORTRAN. If stacks were your thing, you created a language that looked like Forth. And who knows if the belief in objects as the one paradigm will ever again see Orodruin and feel the heat of the flames in which it was forged. Some of these languages were totalitarian -- they insisted everything be shoehorned into their central concept. I recall some very unpleasant struggles with early dialects of SNOBOL, LISP and Prolog. Imperative languages tended to be more elastic. But, while the strictness of adherence varies, almost every language invented over the past 50 years bears the clear stamp of minimalism.</p>
                    <p>LALR parsing rode on the backs of yacc and the Portable C Compiler into total dominance over parsing mindshare. LALR came to define production-quality parsing. In 1978, there had been two C compilers, both at AT&T's Bell Labs -- Ritchie's original, and Johnson's Portable C Compiler, which was about to replace it. Neither was a commercial product -- AT&T was a regulated monopoly, banned from selling hardware or software. By 2006, C was the most important systems programming language in a world which had become far more dependent on computer systems. There were now many C compilers, several of them of great commercial importance. Arguably, one of these was the most visible production-quality C compiler. This no longer came from AT&T. The leader among C compilers in 2006 was GCC, the GNU foundation's flagship accomplishment. GCC can be said to have clearly taken this lead by 1994, when BSD UNIX had switched from the Portable C Compiler to GCC. This was a revolution of another kind, but as far as the parsing algorithm went, it was "Hail to the new boss... same as the old boss". GCC parsing was firmly in the LALR tradition. <br>But on 28 February 2006, the nearly 3 decades of LALR dominance were over. That's the date of the change log for GCC 4.1. It's a long document, and the relevant entry is deep inside it. It's one of the shorter change descriptions. In fact, it's exactly this one sentence: The old Bison-based C and Objective-C parser has been replaced by a new, faster hand-written recursive descent parser. For me, that's a little like reading page 62,518 of the Federal Register and spotting a one-line notice: Effective immediately, Manhattan belongs to the Indians.</p>

Winston Churchill thought the important thing was the broad sense, and that historians should awaken the reader to what really mattered, not deaden him with forgettable detail.</p>

                    <p>2006-10-31:  The default prefix used to be "sqlite_". But then Mcafee started using SQLite in their anti-virus product and it started putting files with the "sqlite" name in the c:/temp folder. This annoyed many windows users. Those users would then do a  Google search for "sqlite", find the telephone numbers of the developers and call to wake them up at night and complain. For this reason, the default name prefix is changed to be "sqlite"  spelled backwards.  So the temp files are still identified, but anybody smart enough to figure out the code is also likely smart enough to know that calling the developer will not help get rid of the file.</p>

                    <p>URL shorteners may be one of the worst ideas, one of the most backward ideas, to come out of the last five years. In very recent times, per-site shorteners, where a website registers a smaller version of its hostname and provides a single small link for a more complicated piece of content within it… those are fine. But these general-purpose URL shorteners, with their shady or fragile setups and utter dependence upon them, well. If we lose TinyURL or bit.ly, millions of weblogs, essays, and non-archived tweets lose their meaning. Instantly. To someone in the future, it’ll be like everyone from a certain era of history, say ten years of the 18th century, started speaking in a one-time pad of cryptographic pass phrases.
                    <br>
                    But the biggest burden falls on the clicker, the person who follows the links. The extra layer of indirection slows down browsing with additional DNS lookups and server hits. A new and potentially unreliable middleman now sits between the link and its destination. And the long-term archivability of the hyperlink now depends on the health of a third party. The shortener may decide a link is a Terms Of Service violation and delete it. If the shortener accidentally erases a database, forgets to renew its domain, or just disappears, the link will break. If a top-level domain changes its policy on commercial use, the link will break. If the shortener gets hacked, every link becomes a potential phishing attack.</p>

					<p>The increasing population in the US, and the demands of Congress to ask more questions in each census, was making the processing of the data a longer and longer process. It was anticipated that the 1890 census data would not be processed before the 1900 census was due unless something was done to improve the processing methodology. Herman Hollerith won the competition for the delivery of data processing equipment to assist in the processing of the data from the 1890 US Census, and went on to assist in the census processing for many countries around the world. The company he founded, Hollerith Tabulating Company, eventually became one of the three that composed the Calculating-Tabulating-Recording (C-T-R) company in 1914, and eventually was renamed IBM in 1924.</p>

					<p>Still, I recall a brief exchange with a physicist who was sitting next to me listening to a panel discussion on Theoretical Computer Science and Physics (which took place in the early 1990s): They [the TCS guys] talk as if a bit is as fundamental as an electron - he told me with amazement. That's of course wrong, a bit is far more fundamental - I answered to his even greater amazement. Needless to say, he did not talk to me during the rest of the panel...
					<br>An electron is merely a specific model of a specific phenomena. It is a very important model, but how can you compare its importance to the importance of the notion of a model? But, then, all models are built of binary attributes.
					<br>This reminds me of a drive from MIT to Providence that Shafi and me made in the mid-1980's. We stopped in a diner on the way, got some food and coffee, and then Shafi asked the attendant Do you have the notion of a refill? The answer was: Yes, we do have refills, but what is a notion?
					<br>Indeed, people may use notions without having a notion of a notion, and likewise they may think of bits without a clear conceptualizing of the pure notion of a bit. In both cases, these notions exist before we conceptualize them; these notions are preconditions to any conceptualization.</p>

					<p>Long ago, I observed that Edsger Dijkstra’s dining philosopher’s problem received much more attention than I thought it deserved. For example, it isn’t nearly as important as the self-stabilization problem, also introduced by Dijkstra, which received almost no notice for a decade. I realized that it was the story that went with it that made the problem so popular. I felt that the Byzantine generals problem (which was discovered by my colleagues at SRI International; was really important, and I wanted it to be noticed. So, I formulated it in terms of Byzantine generals, taking my inspiration from a related problem that I had heard described years earlier by Jim Gray as the Chinese generals problem.</p>

                    <p>Imagine if there were a tunnel which ran into your basement from the outside world, ending in a sturdy door with four or five high-security locks which anybody could approach completely anonymously. A mail slot in the door allows you to receive messages and news delivered through the tunnel, but isn't big enough to allow intruders to enter. Now imagine that every time you go down into your basement, you found several hundred letters piled up in a snowdrift extending from the mail slot, and that to find the rare messages from your friends and family you had to sort through reams of pornography of the most disgusting kind, solicitations for criminal schemes, “human engineered” attempts to steal your identity and financial information, and the occasional rat, scorpion, or snake slipped through the slot to attack you if you're insufficiently wary. You don't allow your kids into the basement any more for fear of what they may see coming through the slot, and you're worried by the stories of people like yourself who've had their basements filled with sewage or concrete spewed through the mail slot by malicious “pranksters”. Further, whenever you're in the basement you not only hear the incessant sound of unwanted letters and worse dropping through the mail slot, but every minute or so you hear somebody trying a key or pick in one of your locks. As a savvy basement tunnel owner, you make a point of regularly reading tunnel security news to learn of “exploits” which compromise the locks you're using so you can update your locks before miscreants can break in through the tunnel. You may consider it wise to install motion detectors in your basement so you're notified if an intruder does manage to defeat your locks and gain entry. As the risks of basement tunnels make the news more and more often, industry and government begin to draw up plans to “do something” about them. A new “trusted door” scheme is proposed, which will replace the existing locks and mail slot with “inherently secure” versions which you're not allowed to open up and examine, whose master keys are guarded by commercial manufacturers and government agencies entirely deserving of your trust. You may choose to be patient, put up with the inconveniences and risks of your basement tunnel until you can install that trusted door. Or, you may simply decide that what comes through the tunnel isn't remotely worth the aggravation it creates and dynamite the whole thing, reclaiming your basement for yourself.</p>

                    <p>If your goal is to get an idea or approach widely used to the largest possible extent, a permissive license like the BSD (or MIT) license has much to offer. Anyone can quickly snap up the code and use it. Much of the TCP/IP code (at least for tools) in Windows was originally from BSD, I believe; there are even some copyright statements still in it. But don't expect the public code to be maintained by those who take and modify the code. I haven't noticed a large number of Microsoft developers being paid to improve any of the *BSDs, even though they share the same code ancestries. If your goal is to have a useful program that stays useful long-term, then a protective license like the LGPL or GPL licenses have much to offer. They force the cooperation that is good for everyone in the long term, if a long-term useful project is the goal. In general, I've noticed that GPL projects are far less likely to fork than BSD-licensed projects; the GPL completely eliminates any financial advantage to forking.
                    <br>One person who agrees with you that the GNU GPL is not the best choice for all circumstances: Richard Stallman. <a href="http://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/rms-ov-license.php3">http://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/rms-ov-license.php3</a>
                    <br>The BSD development teams have been characterised by who
					has a 'commit bit', and who has the power to grant it. BSDs have
					forked not only because of commercial interference but because of
					petty tousles over privilege. [netbsd coup/cabal, etc]
					In one sense, there has only ever been one committer to the Linux
					kernel: Linus Torvalds himself is the only person who applies patches
					to his own tree and is the sole dispenser of 'holy penguin pee'. ... From the start, source code management in Linux was handled by the completely decentralised 'patch'; an inheritance from the Minix hotrodders' community who had no rights over the original source but could swap and improve one another's patches at will.
					<br>Actually the only place where I see a use of BSD license is in creating things that are intended to become standards.
					Like if the gecko (the html rendering) part of Mozilla, was BSD licensed. It would have allowed people in other companies to pickup the code into their browsers. And we would have seen that the html dialect followed by gecko would have become a standard. This was a mistake made by Mozilla.
					Actually BSD license was very useful in the early days of Unix. The License made Unix API into the standard that it is today. Similarly Internet Protocol also became standard because of BSD license.</p>
					<p>I feel I should point out that both the dominant mobile operating systems are Unix-hased.  The UI is necessarily new, but astonishingly the 50 year old basic abstractions are the same.
					<br>Except Unix is kind of hard to see. It wasn't just the hierarchical file system but the idea of composability. Even now we whip up a shell "one-liners" to perform some task we just thought of. All that is lost. And not just on mobile devices. For example search through email messages for something in an email "app". And no UI composability. We have to use extremely heavyweight IDEs such as X-Code weighing at 15GB (even "du -s /Application/X-code" takes tens of seconds!) to painstakingly construct a UI. We can't just whip up a dashboard to measure & display some realtime changing process/entity. There may be equally heavyweight third party tools but there has been no Bell Labs like research crew to distill it down to the essence of composable UI and ship it with every copy. The idea that users too can learn to "program" if given the right tools.</p>

                    <p>There are some major problems on the internet which may seem intractable.

                    <p>In the Crypto Wars, arguments have occasionally been made that there is a constitutional right to cryptography. Most recently, Apple made that argument in trying to fend off the FBI's request to help break into an encrypted phone. It went roughly as follows: writing code is an expressive act, freedom of expression is protected by the First Amendment, and so they can't be forced to express themselves in ways they don't want. I don't think this argument would have fared well in the courts.<br>...<br>But there is an amendment in the Bill of Rights that really is a good match: the Second. The Second Amendment is about private possession of weapons of war; crypto has eminently been a weapon of war. It is about preserving the ability to resist tyranny; and if the government were to have the power to snoop on every communication in a modern computerized society, it would enable a level of tyranny so oppressive as to make every tyranny in history seem mild in comparison. It is also about self-defense against criminals; and there too the fit is good -- not just because cryptography is essential for protecting such things as online banking transactions (though it is); it also ties in to personal self-defense, as might be performed with a firearm.</p>

If &lt;someobject&gt; is the integer 3, then the result will be the integer 7. However, if &lt;someobject&gt; were the string 'Meta', the result might be Meta4. In this way, meaning rides with the objects of the system, and code remains an abstract form, merely directing the flow of communication.</p>

Impotence of the exploited classes in their struggle against the exploiters just as inevitably gives rise to the belief in a better life after death as impotence of the savage in his battle with nature gives rise to belief in gods, devils, miracles, and the like. Those who toil and live in want all their lives are taught by religion to be submissive and patient while here on earth, and to take comfort in the hope of a heavenly reward. But those who live by the labour of others are taught by religion to practise charity while on earth, thus offering them a very cheap way of justifying their entire existence as exploiters and selling them at a moderate price tickets to well-being in heaven. Religion is opium for the people. Religion is a sort of spiritual booze, in which the slaves of capital drown their human image, their demand for a life more or less worthy of man.</p>

                    <p>Reporters are not generally well versed in artistic movements, or the history of literature or art. And most are certain that their readers, or viewers, are of limited intellectual ability and must have things explained simply, in any case. Thus, the reporters in the media tried to relate something that was new to already preexisting frameworks and images that were only vaguely appropriate in their efforts to explain and simplify. With a variety of oversimplified and conventional formulas at their disposal, they fell back on the nearest stereotypical approximation of what the phenomenon resembled, as they saw it. And even worse, they did not see it clearly and completely at that. They got a quotation here and a photograph there—and it was their job to wrap it up in a comprehensible package—and if it seemed to violate the prevailing mandatory conformist doctrine, they would also be obliged to give it a negative spin as well. And in this, they were aided and abetted by the Poetic Establishment of the day. Thus, what came out in the media: from newspapers, magazines, TV, and the movies, was a product of the stereotypes of the 30s and 40s—though garbled—of a cross between a 1920s Greenwich Village bohemian artist and a Bop musician, whose visual image was completed by mixing in Daliesque paintings, a beret, a Vandyck beard, a turtleneck sweater, a pair of sandals, and set of bongo drums. A few authentic elements were added to the collective image: poets reading their poems, for example, but even this was made unintelligible by making all of the poets speak in some kind of phony Bop idiom. The consequence is, that even though we may know now that these images do not accurately reflect the reality of the Beat movement, we still subconsciously look for them when we look back to the 50s. We have not even yet completely escaped the visual imagery that has been so insistently forced upon us</p>

                    <p>When Darwin's theory was published, several years later, church hierarchs agreed that it did not contradict Christian teaching, regardless of whether it was true or not. And Darwin himself did not present his theory as refuting any religious dogma. Immediately after publication, the theory of evolution was generally accepted by society and did not cause a split between religion and science. The war began only 60 years after the publication of Darwin's work, and the reasons for it were political rather than religious or scientific. In the United States, religious fundamentalists have lobbied for a ban on teaching evolution in schools. But why? The fact is that at that time the theory was used to justify the idea of ​​social Darwinism: the strong have the right to oppress the weak. This idea was unacceptable to Christians and especially to Christian socialists. However, their opponents argued that in matters of morality, one should rely on science, not religion. And if science tells us that the weak must perish in the process of natural selection, then so be it. Because of such a stupid interpretation of Darwin's ideas, a protracted conflict between the scientific and religious worldviews began, which now continues to gain momentum. Creationism emerged, which, interpreting the Bible literally, denies not only a hundred years of scientific research, but also two thousand years of Christian theology. On the other hand, ultra-Darwinism has emerged, which tries to apply the theory of evolution to explain everything. Both sides are wrong, the professor says. An adequate understanding of both faith and science does not lead to contradictions. "Since when is it to be a Christian to believe that dinosaurs lived with humans?" Connor wonders. Creationism is not a heir to the Christian tradition, but a dead-end branch of the evolution of human thought.</p>

                    <p>There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record.</p>
                    <p>The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a lag in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of development of devices for their use. Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path. The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.

                    ...
                    This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing. When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions. The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined. Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together from widely separated sources and bound together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails.

                	<p>Vannevar Bush's "library of a million volumes, compressed into one end of a desk" may sound quaint to us today. Bush naively assumed that immediate access to a million volumes would require the physical presence of those million volumes. His proposal -- a million volumes in every desk. The web, of course, took a different approach. A million volumes, yes, but our desks remain empty. Instead, when we summon a volume, we are granted a transient and ephemeral peek at its sole instance, out there somewhere in the world, typically secured within a large institution. Two thoughts: It's interesting that life itself chose Bush's approach. Every cell of every organism has a full copy of the genome. That works pretty well -- DNA gets damaged, cells die, organisms die, the genome lives on. It's been working pretty well for about 4 billion years. It's also interesting to consider how someone from Bush's time might view our situation. For someone who's thinking about a library in every desk, going on the web today might feel like visiting the Library of Alexandria. Things didn't work out so well with the Library of Alexandria. It's not working so well today either. We, as a species, are currently putting together a universal repository of knowledge and ideas, unprecedented in scope and scale. Which information-handling technology should we model it on? The one that's worked for 4 billion years and is responsible for our existence? Or the one that's led to the greatest intellectual tragedies in history?</p>

                    <p>These applications (“appliances” is a better word) come equipped with a fixed vocabulary of actions, speak no common language, and cannot be extended, composed, or combined with other applications except with enormous friction. By analogy, what we have is a railway system where the tracks in each region are of differing widths, forcing trains and their cargo to be totally disassembled and then reassembled to transport anything across the country. As ridiculous as this sounds, this is roughly what we do at application boundaries: write explicit serialization and parsing code and lots of tedious (not to mention inefficient) code to deconstruct and reconstruct application data and functions.
					<br>This essay is a call to cast aside the broken machine metaphor and ultimately end the tyranny of applications. Applications can and ultimately should be replaced by programming environments, explicitly recognized as such, in which the user interactively creates, executes, inspects and composes programs. In this model, interaction with the computer is fundamentally an act of creation, the creative act of programming, of assembling language to express ideas, access information, and automate tasks. And software presents an opportunity to help humanity harness and channel “our vast imaginations, humming away, charged with creative energy”.
					<br>...<br>
					We artificially limit the potential of this incredible technology by reserving a tiny, select group of people (programmers) to use its power build applications with largely fixed sets of actions (and we now put these machines on the internet too and call them “web applications”), and whose behaviors are not composable with other programs. Software let us escape the tyranny of the machine, yet we keep using it to build more prisons for our data and functionality!</p>
					<p>I wouldn’t say ‘perfectly happy’, I’d say that users are resigned to the notion that applications are machines with a fixed set of actions, and any limitations of these machines must simply be worked around via whatever tedium is required.</p>

					<p>This is not just about providing children with the intellectual breadth to get into Oxbridge - it's about cultural entitlement. We're always hearing complaints about how the subsidised theatre and opera are too elitist, but no one ever asks the question about how best to educate people to enjoy them. It's not the job of the arts to dumb down; it's the job of the state to create an intellectually appreciative audience. This won't happen if learning in schools is reduced to a narrow range of disconnected facts, and children will be deprived of their cultural right.</p>

					<p>The peculiarity of decision-making in computing systems is illustrated by some amusing data in More Programming Pearls by Jon Bentley (pp. 157-158). Imagine yourself in 1969, and you need to solve the 1024x1024x1024 Poisson's equation (a particular 3-dimensional system of elliptic partial differential equations). The best numerical method that you can find is called SOR Iteration, and the fastest computer is the CDC 7600 at 5 megaflops. Obviously, your best course is to run SOR on the 7600, right? Well, you will still be less than half done in 1976. I will wait until 1976, use a Cray-1 at 50 megaflops and the Cyclic Reduction method, solving the problem in a matter of hours and winning the race by a long margin.</p>
					<p>Marx's understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface to his 1843 Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right:
					<br>Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.</p>
					<p>So much for the manipulation of ideas and their insertion into the record. Thus far we seem to be worse off than before—for we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. **This is a much larger matter than merely the extraction of data for the purposes of scientific research; it involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge.**</p>

					<p>Despite pulling other ideas from Plan 9, the importance of having an opinion on the distributed nature of modern computing seems to have been missed by prominent operating systems today. As a result, their development has been relegated to what they do: be a platform for things that actually provide an abstraction for my resources.</p>
					<p>Distributed systems that work well on football-sized data centers may not work that well when you only have a few racks in colo facility. The "I forgot how to count that low" challenge is a real one...</p>
					<p>Software folks need to be prepared for the fact that there may actually be nobody who knows how portions of the hardware actually work because it's not all designed at one place anymore.  We have to be prepared for the SoC version of node.js.</p>
					<p>I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
					<br>The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature. It also requires a willing- ness to accept objectives which are limited by physical, logical, and technological constraints, and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be met. No committee will ever do this until it is too late.</p>
					<p>At first I hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse but I soon realized it was doomed to success. Almost anything in software can be imple- mented, sold, and even used given enough determina- tion. There is nothing a mere scientist can say that will stand against the flood of a hundred million dollars. But there is one quality that cannot be purchased in this way--and that is reliability. The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay.</p>
					<p>Among the structuring methods for computer programs, three basic constructs have received widespread recognition and use: A repetitive construct (e.g. the while loop), an alternative construct (e.g. the conditional if..then..else), and normal sequential program composition (often denoted by a semicolon). Less agreement has been reached about the design of other important program structures, and many suggestions have been made: Subroutines (Fortran), procedures (Algol 60), entries (PL/I), coroutines (UNIX), classes (SIMULA67), processes and monitors (Concurrent Pascal), clusters (CLU), forms (ALPHARD), actors (Hewitt).</p>
					<p>(Computer scientist to a professor of linguistics): What can you tell me about the engineering efficiency of language? ...

Why do we have irregular and regular verbs? Why? What are the values?</p>
					<p>There are two languages: you to the machine, and the machine back to you; they need not be the same language. You want a terse one in, and you're willing to put up with a rather more verbose one coming out.</p>

                    <p>The difference between Lisp and Java, as Paul Graham has pointed out, is that Lisp is for working with computational ideas and expression, whereas Java is for expressing completed programs. As James says, Java requires you to pin down decisions early on. And once pinned down, the system which is the set of type declarations, the compiler, and the runtime system make it as hard as it can for you to change those assumptions, on the assumption that all such changes are mistakes you're inadvertently making.
                    <br>There are, of course, many situations when making change more difficult is the best thing to do: Once a program is perfected, for example, or when it is put into light-maintenance mode. But when we are exploring what to create given a trigger or other impetus—when we are in flow—we need to change things frequently, even while we want the system to be robust in the face of such changes.
                    <br>[...]<br>
                    The screwed-up way we approach software development is because of what we have done with programming languages. With some exceptions, we have opted for optimizing the description of programs for compilers, computers, .... Interestingly, the results of this optimization are well-described by <i>"Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming."</i>. [Knuth] was referring to the practice of worrying about performance of an algorithm before worrying about correctness, but the dictum can be taken to refer to any design problem where optimization is an eventual concern. In this case, the design problem was to design a usable programming medium that excels at enabling developers and designers to explore and discover, and to continue to enable discovery and exploration once well into the perfecting stage. Instead of waiting until we understood the ramifications of large system design and implementation using computer programming media, we decided to prematurely optimize for performance and optimization. And we got program description (or programming) languages instead—the root of all evil.</p>

                    <p>But, here we come to something even more egregious. I just defined equality. It’s utterly horrible that I have to now define inequality because what’s the meaning of inequality? Not equality. Could there be any other meaning?
					<br>In 1994 I proposed such a thing to the standard committee. I even proposed bunch of templates which will automatically do it. They threw them out because there were people who said, “but we want to have the freedom to make the glyph != do something else.” I literally have no words because that is not freedom. It’s like saying I want to have freedom to run on the street with no pants! The semantics must be fixed, you have no right to define inequality which will do a semantically different thing.</p>

					<p>In a nutshell, since any software that processes inputs is, in fact, an interpreter, and any inputs are thus its programs, input validation is not essentially different from program verification. To be trustworthy, input validation must therefore be grounded in models that describe precisely what the properties of valid inputs are. Luckily, such models exist, and can be made accessible to regular developers.</p>
					<p>"The Internet has created the most precise mirror of people as a whole that we've yet had. It is not a summary prepared by a social scientist or an elite think tank. It is not the hagiography of an era, condensed by a romantic idealist or a sneering cynic. It is the real us, available for direct inspection for the first time. Our collective window shades are now open. We see the mundanity, the avarice, the ugliness, the perversity, the loneliness, the love, the inspiration, the serendipity, and the tenderness that manifest in humanity. Seen in proportion, we can breathe a sigh of relief. We are basically OK."</p>

					<p>What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing [...] is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.</p>

                    <p>... bad notations can stifle progress. Roman numerals hobbled mathematics for a millennium but
                    were propagated by custom and by natural deference to authority. Today we no longer meekly accept

                    <p> What is the major problem in computer science? Is there one? Can there ever be any? In thinking about it, I have come to the conclusion that if there is any major problem, it is the problem of bridging the gap between neuroscience and psychology. If one looks at neuroscientists, one finds that they work very deep inside the nervous system at an extremely primitive level; they work on neurons. It is as though computer scientists spent all their time looking at gates. On the other end of the spectrum is the psychologist, who sees man as an entity, as a totality, trying to understand what makes him tick. The psychologist's weapons are gross and very, very macroscopic. How can we create a bridge between neuroscience and psychology? My conclusion is that computer science is the discipline that will provide this bridge, and the bridge will come from the study of software. There is a major problem worth sinking your teeth into. Software--collections of symbols that execute processes--is our external way of trying to model the way thinking goes on. Of course, we are very primitive. Nevertheless, it seems to us that is the clue: computer science--if any discipline will--will ultimately provide us the bridge that tells us how the neurons, working as gates, pass signals by the billions in such a way that our brain causes us to behave in a way that psychologists can say, "Ah! I understand."</p>

                    <p>Today man has developed extensions for practically everything he used to do with his body. The evolution of weapons begins with the teeth and the fist and ends with the atom bomb. Clothes and houses are extensions of man's biological temperature-control mechanisms. Furniture takes the place of squatting and sitting on the ground. Power tools, glasses, TV, telephones, and books which carry the voice across both time and space are examples of material extensions. Money is a way of extending and storing labor. Our transportation networks now do what we used to do with our feet and backs. In fact, all man-made material things can be treated as extensions of what man once did with his body or some specialized part of his body.</p>
                    <p>we suppress an organ in the living subject, by a section or ablation; and from the disturbance produced in the whole organism or in a special function, we deduce the function of the missing organ.</p>
                    <p>There are several ways to understand the difference between scientists and writers. One can contrast their methods and stage the difference as an opposition between exptanation and interpretation. In this respect, literature is part of a general field devoted to understanding, as opposed to an explanation through causes and effects: the scientists are discovering laws where the writers are creating meaning. One can contrast their objects of study. This is a more romantic version of the divide: the principles of nature against the torments of the human heart; the fatality of the natural world against the unpredictability of human consciousness and action.</p>
                    <p>Why do all hammers look basically the same? Because there's an 'ideal hammer', and over time hammer design has asymtoted toward that 'ideal hammer' design. One can't just keep improving the design indefinitely - diminishing returns set in. So I suspect there is, to some degree, a Platonic 'ideal syntax' for a 'classic block-structured' programming language, and to me, C came pretty close to it. I except LISP from that assessment, because LISP is built around a fundamentally different model of how computations/algorithms are organized, and C and LISP aren't directly comparable. But that realization points to a deeper bug with the 'Platonic ideal language' concept above, which is that languages are fundamentally, albeit at a very deep conceptual level, tied to the basic concept of the computing hardware they are to run on.</p>

                    <p>A related argument is that engineering approaches are not applicable to cells because these little wonders are fundamentally different from objects studied by engineers. What is so special about cells is not usually specified, but it is implied that real biologists feel the difference. I consider this argument as a sign of what I call the urea syndrome because of the shock that the scientific community had two hundred years ago after learning that urea can be synthesized by a chemist from inorganic materials. It was assumed that organic chemicals could only be produced by a vital force present in living organisms. Perhaps, when we describe signal transduction pathways properly, we would realize that their similarity to the radio is not superficial. In fact, engineers already see deep similarities between the systems they design and live organisms</p>

                    <p>In the case of Intel (x86), Ring -3 is the Intel Management Engine.7 It can turn on nodes and reimage disks invisibly.

                    <p>Among the structuring methods for computer programs, three basic constructs have received widespread recognition and use: A repetitive construct (e.g. the while loop), an alternative construct (e.g. the conditional if..then..else), and normal sequential program composi- tion (often denoted by a semicolon). Less agreement has been reached about the design of other important program structures, and many suggestions have been made: Subroutines (Fortran), procedures (Algol 60 [15]), entries (PL/I), coroutines (UNIX [171), classes (SIMULA67 [5]), processes and monitors (Concurrent Pascal [2]), clusters (CLU [13]), forms (ALPHARD[19]), actors (Hewitt [1]).</p>
                    <p>I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.</p>

                    <p> A year or two after I'd joined the Labs, I was pair programming with Ken Thompson on an on-the-fly compiler for a little interactive graphics language designed by Gerard Holzmann. I was the faster typist, so I was at the keyboard and Ken was standing behind me as we programmed. We were working fast, and things broke, often visibly—it was a graphics language, after all. When something went wrong, I'd reflexively start to dig in to the problem, examining stack traces, sticking in print statements, invoking a debugger, and so on. But Ken would just stand and think, ignoring me and the code we'd just written. After a while I noticed a pattern: Ken would often understand the problem before I would, and would suddenly announce, "I know what's wrong." He was usually correct. I realized that Ken was building a mental model of the code and when something broke it was an error in the model. By thinking about *how* that problem could happen, he'd intuit where the model was wrong or where our code must not be satisfying the model.
                    <br>Ken taught me that thinking before debugging is extremely important. If you dive into the bug, you tend to fix the local issue in the code, but if you think about the bug first, how the bug came to be, you often find and correct a higher-level problem in the code that will improve the design and prevent further bugs.</p>

The speaker responded that they didn't look anything like Richard Feynman, either.)</p>

Obviously there is a close  relation between "third" and "three", "fourth" and "four" and so on.</p>

                    <p>I'm a Unix guy, so I'm thinking about the environment I grew up on. When we gave programmers a virtual machine image with (mostly) protected memory, the unit of computing was process. But since it turned out that the kernel's attempts to isolate processes from each other failed, the unit of computing became virtual machine image, and now the problem is maintaining the isolation between VMs running in a stack -- it's the same problem with just another level of indirection added. Today, we're heading toward disposable networks of disposable nonexistent machines.</p>

I was at a conference that I won't name where Ken gave a talk about his compression work; if I remember correctly his goal was to fit all of the Billboard Top 100 songs of all time onto a single CD.  He showed us the big stack of disks that he made to give to us, but then said that to his surprise the the lawyers refused to give permission.  At that point he became very focused on messing with his slides while everyone got up, got in line, and took a disc.  After the pile was gone Ken looked up and nonchalantly continued his talk.</p>

                    <p>History is repeating itself within the computing microcosm. A computer is a general-purpose device, unlike typical mechanical devices which are built statically and cannot be re-programmed (i.e. a clock). But we are growing weary with general-purpose. While we were busy trying to forge tools abstract enough to do everything, we lost sight of the virtues of specialization. Approaching are data-oriented design, hardware and software designed with each other in mind (e.g. Oxide computing company), domain-specific hardware, domain-specific languages, and so on. One-size-fits-all is a compromise. In general, humans are craving analog devices (i.e. not a computer simulating the behavior of a device) -- something important is lost in simulation.

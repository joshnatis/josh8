	<h3> Hello, World! </h3>

<p class="subtitle">June 17, 2019 &mdash; Josh</p>

<p> Well, here we are. After a few weeks of procrastination I've finally gotten to setting up a blog. A tiny slice of the internet just for me! </p>
<p> I'm hoping to use this as a means of reflecting on things -- I've been so busy lately that I've almost forgotten how to think. </p>

<p><i>Some nice flowers, for testing and aromatic purposes :-)</i></p>
<br>
<p> That's all from me for today! Good night internet. </p>

**In the works:**
* A page where you can talk to Dog himself. Dog is very wise, and he will give you The Wisdom you seek. (He's also animated and probably doesn't work on Internet Explorer).

* Something regarding plants and elephants ♥

**Note:**
* In a blaze of glory, I attempted to clean the original <i>josh8</i> repository of all the junk files it had accumulated over time. StackOverflow proved to be a very dangerous resource, and I ended up messing some things up. So, I started fresh (I only moved the necessary files). I'm relatively sure all went well, but I can't shake the feeling that I've left something behind :(
